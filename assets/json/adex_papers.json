        "abstract": "We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns\nfrom offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online\nwithout access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of\nonline interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We\naddress these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and\nestablish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under\ngeneral function approximations for both expert data and reward-free\ninteractions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result\nthat can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and\ntherefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with\nsecond-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed\nhard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample\ncomplexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited\nexpert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in\nterms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\\epsilon$ and the policy\nvariance $\\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and\ndemonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the\nsample efficiency of existing methods."

Prior work treats this as a\nsecurity problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context\nto subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,\nmost AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can\nbecome a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted\nmodel that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the\nuntrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for\nthis information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector\nby which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in\nthe model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade\ndiverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control\nbenchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on\na monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,\nas its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as\na best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent\na major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard\ncomponent of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms."

        "abstract": "Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for\nwireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections\nintroduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter\nidentification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in\nextracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by\nreceiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise\ntransmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and\nreceiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel\nnoise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the\nRFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is\nparticularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,\nas replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance\ndegradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to\ncross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer\nto explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing\ndomain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware\nsignatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver\nchanges. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our\napproach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a\n10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings."

To resolve these issues, we\nintroduce a formal Bayesian framework that models adversarial uncertainty\nthrough a stochastic channel, articulating all probabilistic assumptions.

Although labeled as\na hybrid kernel, it is found to generally operate in a monolithic manner by\ndefining a single privileged trust zone in which all system functionality\nresides. This has security implications, as a kernel compromise has immediate\nand significant effects on the entire system. Over the past few years, Apple\nhas taken steps towards a more compartmentalized kernel architecture and a more\nmicrokernel-like design. To date, there has been no scientific discussion of\nSPTM and related security mechanisms. Therefore, the understanding of the\nsystem and the underlying security mechanisms is minimal. In this paper, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of new security mechanisms and their\ninterplay, and create the first conclusive writeup considering all current\nmitigations. SPTM acts as the sole authority regarding memory retyping. Our\nanalysis reveals that, through SPTM domains based on frame retyping and memory\nmapping rule sets, SPTM introduces domains of trust into the system,\neffectively gapping different functionalities from one another. Gapped\nfunctionality includes the TXM, responsible for code signing and entitlement\nverification. We further demonstrate how this introduction lays the groundwork\nfor the most recent security feature of Exclaves, and conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of its communication mechanisms. We discover multifold ways of\ncommunication, most notably xnuproxy as a secure world request handler, and the\nTightbeam IPC framework.

However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets\nraises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly\nassume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing\nspecific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers\ncan manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the\ntraining dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the\nVLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes\npredefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.\nSpecifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO\nthat incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.\nIn addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim\nVLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and\nsuccess to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to\nsuccessfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the\nphysical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on\nclean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that\nthe action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack\nperformance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect.

This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive\nbecause the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by\nchance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's\nlow-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the\ntwo directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.\nGradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of\nforgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward\npropagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation.

While recent defenses in image classification have\nsuccessfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these\nmethods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration\nis a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on\nspatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,\nas students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose\nAdaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for\nimage restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher\nusing singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values\nto inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment\nneeded for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the\nteacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:\nsuper-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and\nderaining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by\n60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior\nmethods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach\nprovides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from\nunauthorized knowledge distillation."

To tighten this\ngap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that\nscales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their\noptimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and\nit remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.\n  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives\nexploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than\noptimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the\nremoval of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without\nexplicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic\ntransitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret\nbounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition\nstructures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al.

To address this, we present a novel approach\ninspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not\ncontain executable instructions.

However, it poses significant security risks.\nRecent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which\nintroduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows\nthe adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference\ntime. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor\nattacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\\ Vector\\\n(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned\nbackdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into\nattacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their\nsimilarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that\nenhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\\ Backdoor\\ Vector\\\n(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core\nvulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\\ triggers$ that exploit\nadversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose\n$Injection\\ BV\\ Subtraction\\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against\nbackdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the\nfirst method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same\ntime, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even\nwhen the backdoor threat is entirely unknown."

In\nthis work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be\nmaliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that\nappears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is\nbased on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates\nhow likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary\ncan first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely\nto be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are\nlikely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the\nunpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive\nevaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied\n(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious\nbehaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\\%$\nfor jailbreak, $98.7\\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\\%$ for\ntargeted content injection).

To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been\nproposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation,\noverlooking their broader impacts across other risk dimensions. In this work,\nwe take the first step in investigating unintended interactions caused by\ndefenses in LLMs, focusing on the complex interplay between safety, fairness,\nand privacy. Specifically, we propose CrossRiskEval, a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to assess whether deploying a defense targeting one risk\ninadvertently affects others. Through extensive empirical studies on 14\ndefense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal\nseveral alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses\nto sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect\nprivacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of\nmisuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and\nexacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to\nuncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the\nexistence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing\nsensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency\nanalysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key\nrole in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense\ndeployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward\nholistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies."

We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that\ndecouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based\nneighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to\n$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity\ncomparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,\nreducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +\nd|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the\naccepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both\nstrongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression\npreserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where\napproximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$ factor in the effective\nthreshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,\nnetwork topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains\nidentical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation\ntime by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering\neffectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality\nand network connectivity.

The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it\ndemonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,\npresenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure."

The investigation reveals a\npronounced architecture dependent security-robustness trade-off: pixel-space\nmodels achieve high security against steganalysis but exhibit fragility to\nchannel distortions, while VAE-based systems like Stable Diffusion offer\nsubstantial robustness at the cost of security vulnerabilities. Further\nanalysis indicates that the VAE component drives this behavior through opposing\nmechanisms where the encoder confers robustness via manifold regularization\nwhile the decoder introduces vulnerabilities by amplifying latent perturbations\ninto detectable artifacts.

This work demonstrates for the first time\nthat poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents\nregardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning\nexperiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on\nchinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned\ndocuments similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,\ndespite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data.

Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating\nensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to\npre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical\nrepresentations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate\nMixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to\nDropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout\nmitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned\nweights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby\nmaintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our\nstudy reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain\ngeneralization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9\nfor ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it\nyields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates\nmore strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting\nbetter generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking\nsubstantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by\nup to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%.

However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are\ngiven access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying\nthat inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues\nthat compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via\nits in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive\nspecifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness\nfrom Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as\nthe model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We\nempirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack\ntypes, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification\nfollowing on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL\nfinetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing\nemphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of\ngradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial\npretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to\nnot-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness\nbenefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:\nattacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding\ncompositional generalization to OOD data.

The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains.

Specifically, once learning\nrates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely\nindependent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the\ntraining dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate\nquantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled\nexperiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that\nincreasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,\ndemonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can\nimprove quantization quality at scale."

While the\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,\nits application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper\npresents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in\nvideo reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and\nleading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a\nphenomenon we term \"visual thinking drift\". We explain this drift through a\nBayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual\nevidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models\nto storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we\nintroduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning\nframework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are\nverifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10\ndiverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER\nconsistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct\nchallenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that\nrobustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal\nmodels that not only \"think before answering\", but also \"see while thinking\"."

We separately analyzed the effect of each\ncomponent in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and\nLLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor\nimprovements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current\nguardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to\nretrieval and query composition."

Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the\naccuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and\nmovement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin\nregions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.\nWe introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions\nto enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all\nover the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such\nas the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is\nevaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,\ncalled SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results\nindicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in\nchallenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the\nmean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other\nmethods fail to do so.

In this paper, we introduce ProAct,\na novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead autonomous\njailbreaking processes. Our core idea is to intentionally provide adversaries\nwith \"spurious responses\" that appear to be results of successful jailbreak\nattacks but contain no actual harmful content. These misleading responses\nprovide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the\nadversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the\njailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs,\njailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\\%. When combined with\nother defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest\nattack strategies to 0\\%. ProAct represents an orthogonal defense strategy that\ncan serve as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most\neffective jailbreaking attacks."

IQA methods are implemented with\nvariable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward\nimplementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when\nevaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for\nwell-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal\ndomain.\n  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based\nIQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability\nand fast prediction.

Modern machine learning approaches often falter due to two\nopposing pitfalls: over-specializing on a single, well-known chaotic system\n(e.g., Lorenz-63), which limits generalizability, or indiscriminately mixing\nvast, unrelated time-series, which prevents the model from learning the nuances\nof any specific dynamical regime. We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting\n(CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data\nbased on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a\ncurriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex,\nchaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent\nand attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first\ntraining a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more\nchaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable\nrepresentation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic\nODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum. Our experiments show that\npre-training with CCF significantly enhances performance on unseen, real-world\nbenchmarks. On datasets including Sunspot numbers, electricity demand, and\nhuman ECG signals, CCF extends the valid prediction horizon by up to 40%\ncompared to random-order training and more than doubles it compared to training\non real-world data alone.

To address this issue, we first\nconduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD)\nmodel, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our\nfindings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting\ndistinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its\nembedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \\textbf{SafeGuider}, a\ntwo-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising\ngeneration quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model\nwith a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration\nenables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign\nprompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain\nattacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack\nsuccess rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\\% across various attack\nscenarios.

Specially, WIES's open environment\ncontinuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs,\nexacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional\neducational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a\nDiffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first\nconstructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies\nrelation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two\nsubgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived,\nsemantically augmented representations.

This pipeline presents an underexplored attack surface\nwhere errors in selection can lead to severe outcomes like unauthorized data\naccess or denial of service, all without modifying the agent's model or code.\nWhile existing evaluations measure task performance in benign settings, they\noverlook the specific vulnerabilities of the tool selection mechanism under\nadversarial conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ToolCert, the first\nstatistical framework that formally certifies tool selection robustness.\nToolCert models tool selection as a Bernoulli success process and evaluates it\nagainst a strong, adaptive attacker who introduces adversarial tools with\nmisleading metadata, and are iteratively refined based on the agent's previous\nchoices. By sampling these adversarial interactions, ToolCert produces a\nhigh-confidence lower bound on accuracy, formally quantifying the agent's\nworst-case performance. Our evaluation with ToolCert uncovers the severe\nfragility: under attacks injecting deceptive tools or saturating retrieval, the\ncertified accuracy bound drops near zero, an average performance drop of over\n60% compared to non-adversarial settings. For attacks targeting the retrieval\nand selection stages, the certified accuracy bound plummets to less than 20%\nafter just a single round of adversarial adaptation.

Recently, various instruction hierarchy\ndefense strategies are proposed to effectively defend against prompt injection\nattacks via fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore more vicious attacks that\nnullify the prompt injection defense methods, even the instruction hierarchy:\nbackdoor-powered prompt injection attacks, where the attackers utilize the\nbackdoor attack for prompt injection attack purposes. Specifically, the\nattackers poison the supervised fine-tuning samples and insert the backdoor\ninto the model. Once the trigger is activated, the backdoored model executes\nthe injected instruction surrounded by the trigger. We construct a benchmark\nfor comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that backdoor-powered\nprompt injection attacks are more harmful than previous prompt injection\nattacks, nullifying existing prompt injection defense methods, even the\ninstruction hierarchy techniques."

While AdamW is the de facto standard, recent structure-aware optimizers\nlike Muon have emerged, which regularize gradient updates by operating on\nentire weight matrices. The Muon optimizer balances the gradient updates along\nall the directions. However, Muon's reliance on the matrix sign function can\nlead to training instability, exhibits incompatibility when fine-tuning models\npre-trained with AdamW. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{REG},\na novel optimizer that replaces Muon's aggressive matrix sign operator with the\nRow-and-Column-Scaling (RACS) operator. Theoretically grounded in balancing a\nmatrix, the RACS operator regularizes the update steps in a less drastic\nmanner, making it simpler to implement and more compatible with established\ntraining dynamics. Through extensive empirical experiments on LLM training, we\ndemonstrate that our REG optimizer not only achieves superior performance and\nstability over AdamW, but also maintains consistency with the AdamW training\nparadigm. This consistency is particularly evident during the fine-tuning\nstage, where REG optimizer avoids the performance degradation observed with\nMuon."

A key\nchallenge in FL is Non-IID data. Quantity Skew (QS) is a particular problem of\nNon-IID, where clients hold highly heterogeneous data volumes. Clustered\nFederated Learning (CFL) is an emergent variant of FL that presents a promising\nsolution to Non-IID problem. It improves models' performance by grouping\nclients with similar data distributions into clusters. CFL methods generally\nfall into two operating strategies. In the first strategy, clients select the\ncluster that minimizes the local training loss. In the second strategy, the\nserver groups clients based on local model similarities.

        "abstract": "Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several\nautomobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging\nenvironments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work\nzones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and\ndynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we conduct the \\textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone\ntrajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct\ntrajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first\nidentify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and\nthen confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human\nverification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory\nplanning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases\ninto constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG\nretrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.\nExperimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a\nreduction of around $3\\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM\nbaselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the\nlowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning\n($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone\nscenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of\nREACT-Drive."

The\nenvironment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic\nnoise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot\ntraps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender\nagents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward\nframework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while\nincremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across\nmultiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation\ndifficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that\ndefender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to\nsuccessful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful\ntraining scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial\nsetting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+\ntraining episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex\ndefensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.\nComplete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,\nand architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in\nadversarial RL for cybersecurity.

In contrast, deep\nlearning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise\ncharacteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require\nextensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise\ntypes and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,\ntermed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained\nnetworks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation\nof Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised\npre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained\nnetwork adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without\nrequiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned\nrepresentations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising\nperformance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise\npatterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited\ntraining data.

        "abstract": "Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and\nclustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great\nsuccess, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive\nobjective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary\ninformation to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on\nnode-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding\nrepresentations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a\nmore comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive\nlearning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides\nedge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high\nconfidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively\nidentifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an\ninnovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually\nreinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability\nin representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against\nseveral state-of-the-art CAGC methods."

To\nbridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that\nsystematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target\nharmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse\nred-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to\neffectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel\nmultimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs\n(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming\nalgorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity\nand effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an\nepsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-\nand policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,\nexceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on\nClaude-4-Sonnet.

In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise.

In contrast to existing attacks, DTA\nsignificantly reduces the discrepancy between the target and the output\ndistribution, substantially easing the optimization process to search for an\neffective adversarial prompt.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency\nof DTA: under the white-box setting, DTA only needs 200 optimization iterations\nto achieve an average attack success rate (ASR) of over 87\\% on recent\nsafety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15\\%.

A highly parallel,\nFPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true\nrandom numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with\nminimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to\n18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.\nWith nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established\nscalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106\nparallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large\nlanguage model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as\npractical security components for next-generation GAI systems."

PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling\nself-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale\n(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types\nof noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement\ninaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during\ntransmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these\nchallenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,\nthe original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the\ncontinuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.\nSecond, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron\nencoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are\nconcatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are\nthen fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a\nnovel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and\nextensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise\nrobustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models\nunder different noisy environments."

Existing defenses\nfall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter\nunsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that\npolice behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent\nlacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and\ndelegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a\nsingle-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and\nadding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we\npropose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning\nframework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on\nexternal guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize\nevolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both\naccomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning\nenvironments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a\npublic baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional\ngroup share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates\nand stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,\nAdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas\nbaselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task\naccuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and\nutility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added\nsystem overhead."

        "abstract": "Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a\nparticularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.\nEarly diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist\ndue to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage\nof healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while\npromising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced\nreliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate\noverfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with\nlimited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that\ncombines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for\noral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs\nvariational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty\nquantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by\nsmartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method\nachieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of\nthe training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for\nreal-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations\ndiffering from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior\ngeneralizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%\nfor traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed\nthat the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly\nclassified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified\nsamples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in\ndata-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving\nmodel reliability and generalizability."

        "abstract": "Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in\npractical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy\ndynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans\nseek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future\ndecision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents\nhave addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies\nbetween their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce\nInformation Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making\nframework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to\nalign internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both\nagent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to\nactively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,\ndetect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising\ntask-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark\nsuite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations\nand uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%\nabsolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample\nefficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms\nbaselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web\nnavigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating\nplanning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable\nenvironments.

        "abstract": "The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial\nexamples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text\njailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a\npair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image\njailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking\ndifference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability\nof attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can\ntransfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not\nwithout geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and\nempirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we\nmathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks\ncompute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as\nsuccessful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak\nthe attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space\nattacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that\nrepresentation space attacks can transfer when VLMs' latent geometries are\nsufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that adversarial\ntransfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent on their\noperational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique representation\nspaces - a critical insight for building more robust models."

Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection,\nleaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs. We\npresent JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three\nescalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0),\nsingle-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M). We pair this with a\nhierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii)\nattack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability,\nmoving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm. Using seven LLMs from five\nfamilies as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code\nagents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27%\nrun end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~\n100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the\nmulti-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly\ndeployable attack code.
