To\nimprove the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental\nstate perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a\ncalibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted\nAdversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised\nlearning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains\nthe agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results\nsubstantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state\nperturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results\ndemonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may\nnot be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of\nagents against environmental state perturbations across various situations."

We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial\nprompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe\nrepresentation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface\nlevel defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to\nthe latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated\nadversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts\nacross three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.\nEvaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates\n(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying\nvulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where\nadversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate\nthis vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware\nContrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning\nwith latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent\nseparation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion\namong unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled\nembeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry\nwithout modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.\nMoreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent\nalignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when\nunsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens\ninto how models internally encode safety.

In many real-world applications, like the recognition\nof watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine\ntransformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this\nissue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only\nrequires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary\naffine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the\nmax-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against\nnon-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its\nseparability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nbetween the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nonly allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a\nmean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the\nWasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive\nnoise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical\nexperiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well\nas their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise."

        "abstract": "The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) offers unparalleled\nstructural coverage at near-experimental accuracy, positioning it as a valuable\nresource for data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in training\ndeep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse\nfolding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural\nfeature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical\nregularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the\nconformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the\nProtein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,\nPDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential\nfor generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we\nintroduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct\nnative-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By\ntraining the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly\ncaptures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying\nDeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly\nimprove inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks. This work\nhighlights the critical impact of subtle systematic biases in predicted\nstructures and presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly\nboosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks like inverse\nfolding."

        "abstract": "Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker\nverification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,\nthe security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and\nspeech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to\nbecome vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited\nnumber of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In\nthis paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on\nspeech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large\nLanguage Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of\ntriggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher\nattack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple\nGradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this\nchallenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack\n(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two\nspeech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger\neffectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics."

At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the\nagent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the\nagent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought\ntrajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and\nthe user's instruction.

First, the known conversion of pure DP\nprograms to pure JOT-DP programs in the unbounded setting (a) incurs a constant\nadditive increase in error probability (and thus does not provide vanishing\nerror as $n\\to\\infty$) (b) produces JOT-DP programs that fail to preserve the\ncomputational efficiency of the original pure DP program and (c) is analyzed in\na toy computational model in which the runtime is defined to be the number of\ncoin flips. In this work, we overcome these limitations. Specifically, we show\nthat the error required for pure JOT-DP in the unbounded setting depends on the\nmodel of computation. In a randomized RAM model where the dataset size $n$ is\ngiven (or can be computed in constant time) and we can generate random numbers\n(not just random bits) in constant time, polynomially small error probability\nis necessary and sufficient.

Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant\ndifferences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly\nshare common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.\nTherefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining\nshared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise\nheterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation\nsurrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared\nrelation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized\nrelation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this\nway, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily\nfine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack\nperformances and generalizability of our method."

Traditional static or centralized defense\nmechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework\nfor proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,\nwe design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader\nswitching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent\nflexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network\nresilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,\nresource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV\nis equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions\nbased on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy\ngradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense\npolicies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without\nsharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack\nmitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and\ndecreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,\nrespectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS\nattack strategies."

Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that\nleverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers.

        "abstract": "Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and\nreasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement\nof reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes\nintroduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning\nis strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs\nexhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and\ngeneral-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful\ninstructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning\nquestions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a\nharmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the\nmodel is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on\nHauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results\nreveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety\nvulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different\nmodels, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,\nproviding valuable insights into the security of LRMs."

To address this issue, a defense strategy named\nKNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and\nnearest-neighbor search in feature space.

In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing\nmethods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the\nproposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on\nPointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively.

This paper proposes a\nrobust SDN-based False Data Detection and Mitigation System (FDDMS) for\nin-vehicle networks. Leveraging the unique capabilities of Software-Defined\nNetworking (SDN), FDDMS is designed to monitor and detect false data injection\nattacks in real-time. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs within an\nSDN-enabled in-vehicle network. First, we decode raw CAN data to create an\nattack model that illustrates how false data can be injected into the system.\nThen, FDDMS, incorporating a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection\nmodel, is used to identify false data injection attacks. We further propose an\neffective variant of DeepFool attack to evaluate the model's robustness. To\ncountermeasure the impacts of four adversarial attacks including Fast gradient\ndescent method, Basic iterative method, DeepFool, and the DeepFool variant, we\nfurther enhance a re-training technique method with a threshold based selection\nstrategy. Finally, a mitigation scheme is implemented to redirect attack\ntraffic by dynamically updating flow rules through SDN. Our experimental\nresults show that the proposed FDDMS is robust against adversarial attacks and\neffectively detects and mitigates false data injection attacks in real-time."

One of these security risks is the\nthreat of LLM poisoning attacks where an attacker modifies some part of the LLM\ntraining process to cause the LLM to behave in a malicious way. As an emerging\narea of research, the current frameworks and terminology for LLM poisoning\nattacks are derived from earlier classification poisoning literature and are\nnot fully equipped for generative LLM settings. We conduct a systematic review\nof published LLM poisoning attacks to clarify the security implications and\naddress inconsistencies in terminology across the literature. We propose a\ncomprehensive poisoning threat model applicable to categorize a wide range of\nLLM poisoning attacks. The poisoning threat model includes four poisoning\nattack specifications that define the logistics and manipulation strategies of\nan attack as well as six poisoning metrics used to measure key characteristics\nof an attack. Under our proposed framework, we organize our discussion of\npublished LLM poisoning literature along four critical dimensions of LLM\npoisoning attacks: concept poisons, stealthy poisons, persistent poisons, and\npoisons for unique tasks, to better understand the current landscape of\nsecurity risks."

Among these is transmitter\nfingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be\nauthenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as\nimpairments on the signal.\n  Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite\ntransmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple\nreplay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks\ndirectly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for\nmaximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and\ndemonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium\ntransmitters. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error\nrate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than\ntraditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during\nspoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own\ntransmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a data poisoning\nattack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering the data used to\nauthenticate incoming messages to include the fingerprint of the attacker's\ntransmitter.\n  Finally, we show that our model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also\nbe used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the\nattacker's transmitter before. Furthermore, this technique works even when the\ntraining dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to\nbe used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites,\nproviding additional protection where it is needed the most."

In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected\nto the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled\nby a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this\npaper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be\ndifferent. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should\nbe injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new\nframework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).\nSpecifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data\npoint deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,\nbased on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to\nadaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise\ninjections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods\nresults in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10\nand ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels\nto different samples in DBP methods.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate\nsignificant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive\ncomputational cost during inference. While several distillation-based\napproaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,\nextending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,\nparticularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In\nthis work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,\nwhich performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the\nchallenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several\nenhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,\nan adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is\ndynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window\ninconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a\npredefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training\ntowards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,\nincluding a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing\ntraining efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve\ncomparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a\nsingle step."

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake\nwhich takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't\nknow how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the\nfish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather\nthan teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving\nthe expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In\nresponse, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.\nlearning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert\noutcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)\na reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions\nrequired to combine these and other components for stable and\nsample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional\nhuman corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three\nbenchmarks, our approach $\\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs\nstate-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.\nFurthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by\n5-10$\\times$ still leaves a performance gap.

        "abstract": "Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language\nprocessing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks\nsuch as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to\ntraditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a\nchallenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating\nthe robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and\nlanguage modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we\ntrain a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and\ngenerate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial\nperturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack\nstrategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning\ndatasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results\nindicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and\nsingle-modality attacks from the recent literature.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)\ntask-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot\nadaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma\nwith the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial\nPartial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the\nvisual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial\nfinetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF\nachieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD\nbenchmarks."

For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends.

This paper\nintroduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can\neffectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding\nminimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its\nlatent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP\ncumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input\ndata.

        "abstract": "Achieving differentially private computations in decentralized settings poses\nsignificant challenges, particularly regarding accuracy, communication cost,\nand robustness against information leakage. While cryptographic solutions offer\npromise, they often suffer from high communication overhead or require\ncentralization in the presence of network failures. Conversely, existing fully\ndecentralized approaches typically rely on relaxed adversarial models or\npairwise noise cancellation, the latter suffering from substantial accuracy\ndegradation if parties unexpectedly disconnect. In this work, we propose IncA,\na new protocol for fully decentralized mean estimation, a widely used primitive\nin data-intensive processing. Our protocol, which enforces differential\nprivacy, requires no central orchestration and employs low-variance correlated\nnoise, achieved by incrementally injecting sensitive information into the\ncomputation. First, we theoretically demonstrate that, when no parties\npermanently disconnect, our protocol achieves accuracy comparable to that of a\ncentralized setting-already an improvement over most existing decentralized\ndifferentially private techniques. Second, we empirically show that our use of\nlow-variance correlated noise significantly mitigates the accuracy loss\nexperienced by existing techniques in the presence of dropouts."

Traditional position encoding methods exhibit\nsignificant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position.\nTherefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these\nissues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in\nthe attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation\nmatrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity.\nIn this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in\nterms of trainable commuting angle matrices.

We formally define the RoPE Equation,\nwhich is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with\nposition offsets.

Existing methods fuse\nfeatures or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified\nrepresentation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to\nfully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate\nmulti-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and\npropose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross\nModality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing\nmodalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into\nRGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing\nseparate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established\npretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X\nmodalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching\n(MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all\nmodalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's\nstrengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features\nwithin their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality\ncontributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing\nmodalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which\nenhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally\nmatched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world\nmulti-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving\nsignificant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts."

To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a\nnovel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of\nLLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error\nCorrection stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate\nadversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that\nautomatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an\noptimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model\ntoward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments\nspanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate\nthat RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial\nperturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal\ndegradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a\npractical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world\napplications."

To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes\ndue to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that\napplies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a\nself-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the\ntwo models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency\nof model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy,\nwhich replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential\nMoving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to\npreserve divergence.

Our approaches are as follows: For the Frank-Wolfe\nmethod, our technique is based on a tailored learning rate and a uniform lower\nbound on the gradient of the $\\ell_2$-norm over the constraint set. For\naccelerating projected gradient descent, we use the popular variant based on\nNesterov's momentum, and we optimize our objective over $\\mathbb{R}^p$.

Our\nanalysis covers three settings: non-random data, random model-free data, and\nparametric models (linear regression and generalized linear models).\nMethodologically, we approach both privacy and robustness based on noisy\ngradients. We ensure differential privacy via the Gaussian mechanism and\nadvanced composition, and we achieve heavy-tailed robustness using a geometric\nmedian-of-means estimator, which also sharpens the dependency on the dimension\nof the covariates.

We\nshow on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small,\nstructured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction\naccuracy, even when training context remain fixed.

To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification\nproblem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the\ncontext (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context\nadversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with\nadversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights.

        "abstract": "Code LLMs are increasingly employed in software development. However, studies\nhave shown that they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks: when a trigger (a\nspecific input pattern) appears in the input, the backdoor will be activated\nand cause the model to generate malicious outputs. Researchers have designed\nvarious triggers and demonstrated the feasibility of implanting backdoors by\npoisoning a fraction of the training data. Some basic conclusions have been\nmade, such as backdoors becoming easier to implant when more training data are\nmodified. However, existing research has not explored other factors influencing\nbackdoor attacks on Code LLMs, such as training batch size, epoch number, and\nthe broader design space for triggers, e.g., trigger length.\n  To bridge this gap, we use code summarization as an example to perform an\nempirical study that systematically investigates the factors affecting backdoor\neffectiveness and understands the extent of the threat posed. Three categories\nof factors are considered: data, model, and inference, revealing previously\noverlooked findings. We find that the prevailing consensus -- that attacks are\nineffective at extremely low poisoning rates -- is incorrect. The absolute\nnumber of poisoned samples matters as well. Specifically, poisoning just 20 out\nof 454K samples (0.004\\% poisoning rate -- far below the minimum setting of\n0.1\\% in prior studies) successfully implants backdoors! Moreover, the common\ndefense is incapable of removing even a single poisoned sample from it.\nAdditionally, small batch sizes increase the risk of backdoor attacks. We also\nuncover other critical factors such as trigger types, trigger length, and the\nrarity of tokens in the triggers, leading to valuable insights for assessing\nCode LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks.

Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and ML tasks (data\ncleaning, fairness-aware learning, uncertainty quantification) demonstrate that\neven a small fraction (around 5 %) of structured corruptions identified by\nSAVAGE severely impacts model performance, far exceeding random or manually\ncrafted errors, and invalidating core assumptions of existing techniques. Thus,\nSAVAGE provides a practical tool for rigorous pipeline stress-testing, a\nbenchmark for evaluating robustness methods, and actionable guidance for\ndesigning more resilient data workflows."

However,\ndata heterogeneity remains a significant challenge for LoRA-based FL, and the\nconventional aggregation strategy based on FedAvg suffers from slow convergence\nand suboptimal accuracy. Motivated by recent advances in model merging,\nparticularly Task Arithmetic, we explore the idea of aggregating client LoRA\nparameters using scaled averaging. We first observe that a naive application of\nTask Arithmetic is ineffective due to the high cosine similarity between client\nupdates, indicating significant common knowledge in the updates across clients.\nTo address this issue, we propose decomposing client LoRA updates via Robust\nPrincipal Component Analysis (Robust-PCA) into a common low-rank component and\nclient-specific sparse components. Our proposed algorithm FedRPCA aggregates\nthe low-rank components through averaging, consolidating common knowledge, and\napplies scaled averaging to the sparse components to amplify client-specific\nknowledge. We evaluate our approach across a variety of vision and language\ntasks and demonstrate that it achieves higher final accuracy and faster\nconvergence compared to competing baselines."

In vPPML, it is critical to perform the secure dataset join, which\naligns features corresponding to intersection IDs across datasets and forms a\nsecret-shared and joint training dataset. However, existing methods for this\nstep could be impractical due to: (1) they are insecure when they expose\nintersection IDs; or (2) they rely on a strong trust assumption requiring a\nnon-colluding auxiliary server; or (3) they are limited to the two-party\nsetting.\n  This paper proposes IDCloak, the first practical secure multi-party dataset\njoin framework for vPPML that keeps IDs private without a non-colluding\nauxiliary server. IDCloak consists of two protocols: (1) a circuit-based\nmulti-party private set intersection protocol (cmPSI), which obtains\nsecret-shared flags indicating intersection IDs via an optimized communication\nstructure combining OKVS and OPRF; (2) a secure multi-party feature alignment\nprotocol, which obtains the secret-shared and joint dataset using secret-shared\nflags, via our proposed efficient secure shuffle protocol. Experiments show\nthat: (1) compared to the state-of-the-art secure two-party dataset join\nframework (iPrivjoin), IDCloak demonstrates higher efficiency in the two-party\nsetting and comparable performance when the party number increases; (2)\ncompared to the state-of-the-art cmPSI protocol under honest majority, our\nproposed cmPSI protocol provides a stronger security guarantee (dishonest\nmajority) while improving efficiency by up to $7.78\\times$ in time and\n$8.73\\times$ in communication sizes; (3) our proposed secure shuffle protocol\noutperforms the state-of-the-art shuffle protocol by up to $138.34\\times$ in\ntime and $132.13\\times$ in communication sizes."

In this paper, we introduce\nF3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive\n\"fighting fire with fire\" strategy: intentionally introducing simple\nperturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects.\nSpecifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly\nperturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into\nthese adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting\nin cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly\nparadoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks\nyields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct\nadvantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits\nsignificant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing\npurification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for\nlarge-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and\noperational efficiency are critical priorities.

Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based\nattacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic\nsecurity. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of\nhuman-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a\n15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack\nsuccess rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most\nLLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly\nsensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain\nvulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password\nleakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional\npersonal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is\naround 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage.\nTasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely\nresemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs,\nhighlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense\nefficacy."

However, existing in-generation watermarking\ntechniques are primarily designed for diffusion models, where watermarks are\nembedded within diffusion latent states. This design poses significant\nchallenges for direct adaptation to AR models, which generate images\nsequentially through token prediction. Moreover, diffusion-based regeneration\nattacks can effectively erase such watermarks by perturbing diffusion latent\nstates. To address these challenges, we propose Lexical Bias Watermarking\n(LBW), a novel framework designed for AR models that resists regeneration\nattacks. LBW embeds watermarks directly into token maps by biasing token\nselection toward a predefined green list during generation. This approach\nensures seamless integration with existing AR models and extends naturally to\npost-hoc watermarking. To increase the security against white-box attacks,\ninstead of using a single green list, the green list for each image is randomly\nsampled from a pool of green lists. Watermark detection is performed via\nquantization and statistical analysis of the token distribution. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LBW achieves superior watermark robustness,\nparticularly in resisting regeneration attacks."

        "abstract": "Marketing optimization, commonly formulated as an online budget allocation\nproblem, has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving user growth. Most existing\nresearch addresses this problem by following the principle of 'first predict\nthen optimize' for each individual, which presents challenges related to\nlarge-scale counterfactual prediction and solving complexity trade-offs. Note\nthat the practical data quality is uncontrollable, and the solving scale tends\nto be tens of millions. Therefore, the existing approaches make the robust\nbudget allocation non-trivial, especially in industrial scenarios with\nconsiderable data noise. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach that\nsolves the problem from the cluster perspective. Specifically, we propose a\nmulti-task representation network to learn the inherent attributes of\nindividuals and project the original features into high-dimension hidden\nrepresentations through the first two layers of the trained network. Then, we\ndivide these hidden representations into $K$ groups through partitioning-based\nclustering, thus reformulating the problem as an integer stochastic programming\nproblem under different total budgets. Finally, we distill the representation\nmodule and clustering model into a multi-category model to facilitate online\ndeployment. Offline experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of\nour approach compared to six state-of-the-art marketing optimization\nalgorithms. Online A/B tests on the Meituan platform indicate that the approach\noutperforms the online algorithm by 0.53% and 0.65%, considering order volume\n(OV) and gross merchandise volume (GMV), respectively."
