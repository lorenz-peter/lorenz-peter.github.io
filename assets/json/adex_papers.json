        "abstract": "In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21600v1",
        "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21592v1",
        "abstract": "Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

        "abstract": "Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge."

        "abstract": "Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments."

        "abstract": "Evaluating the effectiveness of software protection is crucial for selecting the most effective methods to safeguard assets within software applications. Obfuscation involves techniques that deliberately modify software to make it more challenging to understand and reverse-engineer, while maintaining its original functionality. Although obfuscation is widely adopted, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored and unthoroughly evaluated. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving Master's students performing code comprehension tasks on applications hardened with obfuscation. The experiment's goals are to assess the effectiveness of obfuscation in delaying code comprehension by attackers and to determine whether complexity metrics can accurately predict the impact of these protections on success rates and durations of code comprehension tasks. The study is the first to evaluate the effect of layering multiple obfuscation techniques on a single piece of protected code. It also provides experimental evidence of the correlation between objective metrics of the attacked code and the likelihood of a successful attack, bridging the gap between objective and subjective approaches to estimating potency. Finally, the paper highlights significant aspects that warrant additional analysis and opens new avenues for further experiments."

        "abstract": "With the rapid expansion of data lakes storing health data and hosting AI algorithms, a prominent concern arises: how safe is it to export machine learning models from these data lakes? In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.\n  This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.\n  Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported."

        "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient paradigm for customizing diffusion models, but its ease of redistribution raises concerns over unauthorized use and the generation of untraceable content. Existing watermarking techniques either target base models or verify LoRA modules themselves, yet they fail to propagate watermarks to generated images, leaving a critical gap in traceability. Moreover, traceability watermarking designed for base models is not tightly coupled with stylization and often introduces visual degradation or high false-positive detection rates. To address these limitations, we propose AuthenLoRA, a unified watermarking framework that embeds imperceptible, traceable watermarks directly into the LoRA training process while preserving stylization quality. AuthenLoRA employs a dual-objective optimization strategy that jointly learns the target style distribution and the watermark-induced distribution shift, ensuring that any image generated with the watermarked LoRA reliably carries the watermark. We further design an expanded LoRA architecture for enhanced multi-scale adaptation and introduce a zero-message regularization mechanism that substantially reduces false positives during watermark verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuthenLoRA achieves high-fidelity stylization, robust watermark propagation, and significantly lower false-positive rates compared with existing approaches.

        "abstract": "Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness."

This enables us to build simpler and more effective models, as well as to combine different biological feature sets. Experiments on Dietary Restriction datasets show significant improvements over existing methods, proving that feature selection can be critical for reliable gene prioritization."

To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses."

Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines."

While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects.

We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning."

In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models."

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern.

Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited."

As MCP adoption grows across community servers and major platforms, organizations encounter threats that existing AI governance frameworks (such as NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001) do not yet cover in detail. We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end. We close by outlining open research questions around verifiable registries, formal methods for these dynamic systems, and privacy-preserving agent operations."

We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy).

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller \u0394 across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm)."

        "abstract": "Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs."

        "abstract": "Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training.

In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations."

Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \\textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging.

We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\\% of the data.

However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.\n  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems."

We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with Scrublet, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models."

        "abstract": "A reliable reward function is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in image generation. Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively. Code and models have been released."

Given its massive user base, WhatsApp plays a critical role in global communication.\n  To initiate conversations, users must first discover whether their contacts are registered on the platform. This is achieved by querying WhatsApp's servers with mobile phone numbers extracted from the user's address book (if they allowed access). This architecture inherently enables phone number enumeration, as the service must allow legitimate users to query contact availability. While rate limiting is a standard defense against abuse, we revisit the problem and show that WhatsApp remains highly vulnerable to enumeration at scale. In our study, we were able to probe over a hundred million phone numbers per hour without encountering blocking or effective rate limiting.\n  Our findings demonstrate not only the persistence but the severity of this vulnerability. We further show that nearly half of the phone numbers disclosed in the 2021 Facebook data leak are still active on WhatsApp, underlining the enduring risks associated with such exposures. Moreover, we were able to perform a census of WhatsApp users, providing a glimpse on the macroscopic insights a large messaging service is able to generate even though the messages themselves are end-to-end encrypted. Using the gathered data, we also discovered the re-use of certain X25519 keys across different devices and phone numbers, indicating either insecure (custom) implementations, or fraudulent activity.\n  In this updated version of the paper, we also provide insights into the collaborative remediation process through which we confirmed that the underlying rate-limiting issue had been resolved."

To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates.

However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, a variety of fine-tuning methods have been developed, enabling high-fidelity image generation with high similarity to the target content using only 3 to 5 training images. More recently, zero-shot generation methods have emerged, capable of producing highly realistic outputs from a single reference image without altering model weights. However, technological advancements have also introduced significant risks to facial privacy. Malicious actors can exploit diffusion model customization with just a few or even one image of a person to create synthetic identities nearly identical to the original identity. Although research has begun to focus on defending against diffusion model customization, most existing defense methods target fine-tuning approaches and neglect zero-shot generation defenses. To address this issue, this paper proposes Dual-Layer Anti-Diffusion (DLADiff) to defense both fine-tuning methods and zero-shot methods. DLADiff contains a dual-layer protective mechanism. The first layer provides effective protection against unauthorized fine-tuning by leveraging the proposed Dual-Surrogate Models (DSUR) mechanism and Alternating Dynamic Fine-Tuning (ADFT), which integrates adversarial training with the prior knowledge derived from pre-fine-tuned models. The second layer, though simple in design, demonstrates strong effectiveness in preventing image generation through zero-shot methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in defending against fine-tuning of diffusion models and achieves unprecedented performance in protecting against zero-shot generation."

Generalizability and robustness are two critical concerns of a forgery detector, determining its reliability when facing unknown GANs and noisy samples in an open world. Although many studies focus on improving these two properties, the root causes of these problems have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if there is a connection between them. Moreover, despite recent achievements in addressing these issues from image forensic or anti-forensic aspects, a universal method that can contribute to both sides simultaneously remains practically significant yet unavailable. In this paper, we provide a fundamental explanation of these problems from a frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that the frequency bias of a DNN forgery detector is a possible cause of generalization and robustness issues. Based on this finding, we propose a two-step frequency alignment method to remove the frequency discrepancy between real and fake images, offering double-sided benefits: it can serve as a strong black-box attack against forgery detectors in the anti-forensic context or, conversely, as a universal defense to improve detector reliability in the forensic context. We also develop corresponding attack and defense implementations and demonstrate their effectiveness, as well as the effect of the frequency alignment method, in various experimental settings involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics."

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, representing the most significant security threat in production deployments. We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security."

        "abstract": "Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

        "abstract": "As agentic AI becomes more widespread, agents with distinct and possibly conflicting goals will interact in complex ways. These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19330v1",
        "abstract": "A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline."

        "abstract": "Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs."

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes."

Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance."

Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization."

Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network."

To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed."

In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise."

Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images.

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\\% yielding over 90\\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks. While sign-based methods, such as sign stochastic gradient descent with majority voting (SIGNSGD-MV), offer substantial bandwidth savings, they remain vulnerable to inference attacks due to exposure of gradient signs. Existing secure aggregation techniques are either incompatible with sign-based methods or incur prohibitive overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Hi-SAFE, a lightweight and cryptographically secure aggregation framework for sign-based FL. Our core contribution is the construction of efficient majority vote polynomials for SIGNSGD-MV, derived from Fermat's Little Theorem. This formulation represents the majority vote as a low-degree polynomial over a finite field, enabling secure evaluation that hides intermediate values and reveals only the final result. We further introduce a hierarchical subgrouping strategy that ensures constant multiplicative depth and bounded per-user complexity, independent of the number of users n."

        "abstract": "Recently, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained GNNs has yielded remarkable attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method."

However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices."

While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication. The study also identifies limitations that none of the techniques can fully address, highlighting areas for future work."

However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.

Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation.

        "abstract": "Physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems is concerning due to the ease of deploying such attacks, usually by placing an adversarial patch in a scene to manipulate the outcomes of a deep learning model. Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions."

We further examine the impact of adversarial training at the model-training stage. Extensive experiments support our theory: (i) Prediction coverage varies monotonically with the calibration-time attack strength, enabling the use of nonzero calibration-time attack to predictably control coverage under adversarial tests; (ii) target coverage can hold over a range of test-time attacks: with a suitable calibration attack, coverage stays within any chosen tolerance band across a contiguous set of perturbation levels; and (iii) adversarial training at the training stage produces tighter prediction sets that retain high informativeness."

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art results across various imaging tasks. A central challenge in this setting lies in balancing the contribution of the prior with the data fidelity term: overly aggressive likelihood updates may introduce artifacts, while conservative updates can slow convergence or yield suboptimal reconstructions. In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity. The resulting approach, Adaptive Posterior diffusion Sampling (AdaPS), is hyperparameter-free and improves reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks - including super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring - on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256 validation sets. AdaPS consistently surpasses existing diffusion-based baselines in perceptual quality with minimal or no loss in distortion, without any task-specific tuning. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness to the number of diffusion steps, observation noise levels, and varying stochasticity."

We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism.

Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation.

However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs.

We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning.

Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA."

In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples. Our method reconciles stability and plasticity, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging cold-start settings of the standard EFCIL benchmarks."

        "abstract": "RGB-Thermal (RGBT) tracking aims to exploit visible and thermal infrared modalities for robust all-weather object tracking. However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift. With the above components, our CADTrack achieves robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is released at https://github.com/IdolLab/CADTrack."

        "abstract": "Most applications of generative AI involve a sequential interaction in which a person inputs a prompt and waits for a response, and where reaction time and adaptivity are not important factors. In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models."

In this paper, we study the fixes of incomplete security bugs in the Linux kernel for the first time, and reveal their characteristics, root causes, as well as detection. We first construct a dataset of incomplete security bug fixes in the Linux kernel and answer the following three questions.

However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method."

While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion."

Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to monitor lesion growth longitudinally. Our results indicate that deep learning-based analysis for widefield OCTA images could offer a valuable means for improving RNV screening and management."

We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs.

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making their adversarial robustness a crucial concern. While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly."

However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts."

        "abstract": "Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach."

In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP."

Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments."

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low \"follow rates\" ($\\leq 11\\%$, GPT-5: 4\\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of \"resistance to overfitting pressure\" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world."

We exploit this as an attack surface via Sensitivity-Scaled Steering (SSS), a progressive activation-level attack that combines beginning-of-sequence (BOS) anchoring with sensitivity-based reinforcement to focus a limited perturbation budget on the most vulnerable layers and tokens. We show that across multiple open-weight models and four behavioral axes, SSS induces large shifts in evil, hallucination, sycophancy, and sentiment while preserving high coherence and general capabilities, turning activation steering into a concrete security concern for white-box and supply-chain LLM deployments."

At each epoch, Step-E ranks samples by loss and gradually increases the fraction of high-loss examples that are excluded from gradient updates after a brief warm-up stage, yielding an online curriculum that focuses on easy and consistent examples and eventually ignores persistent outliers. On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%).

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms."

The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies.

        "abstract": "In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain."

        "abstract": "Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against machine learning (ML) models aim to determine whether a given data point was part of the model training data. These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize). Our findings reveal that these samples are often outliers within their classes (e.g., noisy or hard to classify). We then propose potential defensive strategies to protect these vulnerable samples and enhance the privacy-preserving capabilities of ML models.

To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals."

        "abstract": "Incorrectly labelled training data are frustratingly ubiquitous in both benchmark and specially curated datasets. Such mislabelling clearly adversely affects the performance and generalizability of models trained through supervised learning on the associated datasets. Frameworks for detecting label errors typically require well-trained / well-generalized models; however, at the same time most frameworks rely on training these models on corrupt data, which clearly has the effect of reducing model generalizability and subsequent effectiveness in error detection -- unless a training scheme robust to label errors is employed. We evaluate two novel loss functions, Blurry Loss and Piecewise-zero Loss, that enhance robustness to label errors by de-weighting or disregarding difficult-to-classify samples, which are likely to be erroneous. These loss functions leverage the idea that mislabelled examples are typically more difficult to classify and should contribute less to the learning signal. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of artificially corrupted datasets demonstrate that the proposed loss functions outperform state-of-the-art robust loss functions in nearly all cases, achieving superior F1 scores for error detection. Further analyses through ablation studies offer insights to confirm these loss functions' broad applicability to cases of both uniform and non-uniform corruption, and with different label error detection frameworks. By using these robust loss functions, machine learning practitioners can more effectively identify, prune, or correct errors in their training data."

Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors."

        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment."

        "abstract": "With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability."

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes."

However, the real-world robustness of these defenses against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Faceted Attack (MFA), a framework that systematically exposes general safety vulnerabilities in leading defense-equipped VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-4. The core component of MFA is the Attention-Transfer Attack (ATA), which hides harmful instructions inside a meta task with competing objectives. We provide a theoretical perspective based on reward hacking to explain why this attack succeeds. To improve cross-model transferability, we further introduce a lightweight transfer-enhancement algorithm combined with a simple repetition strategy that jointly bypasses both input-level and output-level filters without model-specific fine-tuning. Empirically, we show that adversarial images optimized for one vision encoder transfer broadly to unseen VLMs, indicating that shared visual representations create a cross-model safety vulnerability. Overall, MFA achieves a 58.5% success rate and consistently outperforms existing methods. On state-of-the-art commercial models, MFA reaches a 52.8% success rate, surpassing the second-best attack by 34%.

To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset.

To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible.

As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \\textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \\textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability.

However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics."

        "abstract": "Adversarially perturbed images of text can cause sophisticated OCR systems to produce misleading or incorrect transcriptions from seemingly invisible changes to humans. Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA)."

Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA."

To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework."

Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance."

High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption."

        "abstract": "In high-dimensional statistics, the Lasso is a cornerstone method for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation. However, its reliance on the squared loss function renders it highly sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed noise, potentially leading to unreliable model selection and biased estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce the Exponential Lasso, a novel robust method that integrates an exponential-type loss function within the Lasso framework. This loss function is designed to achieve a smooth trade-off between statistical efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness against data contamination. Unlike other methods that cap the influence of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends, effectively downweighting the impact of extreme outliers while preserving near-quadratic behavior for small errors. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the Exponential Lasso achieves strong statistical convergence rates, matching the classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining its robustness in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination. Computationally, the estimator is optimized efficiently via a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that iteratively solves a series of weighted Lasso subproblems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive, outperforming the classical Lasso in contaminated settings and maintaining strong performance even under Gaussian noise.\n  Our method is implemented in the \\texttt{R} package \\texttt{heavylasso} available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/heavylasso"

Existing FIA methods often produce limited reconstruction quality, making it difficult to assess the true extent of privacy leakage. To reveal the privacy risk of the leaked features, we introduce FIA-Flow, a black-box FIA framework that achieves high-fidelity image reconstruction from intermediate features. To exploit the semantic information within intermediate features, we design a Latent Feature Space Alignment Module (LFSAM) to bridge the semantic gap between the intermediate feature space and the latent space. Furthermore, to rectify distributional mismatch, we develop Deterministic Inversion Flow Matching (DIFM), which projects off-manifold features onto the target manifold with one-step inference. This decoupled design simplifies learning and enables effective training with few image-feature pairs. To quantify privacy leakage from a human perspective, we also propose two metrics based on a large vision-language model. Experiments show that FIA-Flow achieves more faithful and semantically aligned feature inversion across various models (AlexNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, DINO, and YOLO11) and layers, revealing a more severe privacy threat in Split DNNs than previously recognized."

We then derive RCGP-UCB, an algorithm coupling the famous upper confidence bound (UCB) approach with a Robust Conjugate Gaussian Process (RCGP). We present stable and adaptive versions of RCGP-UCB, and prove that they achieve sublinear regret in the presence of up to $O(T^{1/2})$ and $O(T^{1/3})$ corruptions with possibly infinite magnitude. This robustness comes at near zero cost: without outliers, RCGP-UCB's regret bounds match those of the standard GP-UCB algorithm."

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols."

Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples.

This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership.

In this paper, we present a systematization of adversarial robustness in QML, integrating conceptual organization with empirical evaluation across three threat models-black-box, gray-box, and white-box. We implement representative attacks in each category, including label-flipping for black-box, QUID encoder-level data poisoning for gray-box, and FGSM and PGD for white-box, using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) trained on two datasets from distinct domains: MNIST from computer vision and AZ-Class from Android malware, across multiple circuit depths (2, 5, 10, and 50 layers) and two encoding schemes (angle and amplitude). Our evaluation shows that amplitude encoding yields the highest clean accuracy (93% on MNIST and 67% on AZ-Class) in deep, noiseless circuits; however, it degrades sharply under adversarial perturbations and depolarization noise (p=0.01), dropping accuracy below 5%. In contrast, angle encoding, while offering lower representational capacity, remains more stable in shallow, noisy regimes, revealing a trade-off between capacity and robustness. Moreover, the QUID attack attains higher attack success rates, though quantum noise channels disrupt the Hilbert-space correlations it exploits, weakening its impact in image domains. This suggests that noise can act as a natural defense mechanism in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. Overall, our findings guide the development of secure and resilient QML architectures for practical deployment.

We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.\n  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models."

        "abstract": "As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote."

A large variety of different such AT metrics have been proposed, and despite their wide-spread practical use, no systematic treatment of attack tree metrics so far is fully satisfactory. Existing approaches either fail to include important metrics, or they are too general to provide a useful systematic way for defining concrete AT metrics, giving only an abstract characterisation of their behaviour. We solve this problem by developing a compositional theory of ATs and their functorial semantics based on gs-monoidal categories. Viewing attack trees as string diagrams, we show that components of ATs form a channel category, a particular type of gs-monoidal category. AT metrics then correspond to functors of channel categories. This characterisation is both general enough to include all common AT metrics, and concrete enough to define AT metrics by their logical structure."

However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE"

While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability."

Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders."

        "abstract": "To distinguish Markov equivalent graphs in causal discovery, it is necessary to restrict the structural causal model. Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness."

To explore the ecological advantages of such staged \"visual diets\", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released."

        "abstract": "Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS."

We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems.

        "abstract": "Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information."

Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency."

        "abstract": "In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings."

To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling."

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68\u00b0/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88\u00b0/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79\u00b0/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks."

However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench."

The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that our shrinkage estimators perform competitively against state-of-the-art estimators in practical applications."

In particular, jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a tangible threat across industries, driving the need for diverse templates to support red-teaming efforts and strengthen defensive techniques. However, current approaches predominantly rely on two limited strategies: (i) substituting harmful queries into fixed templates, and (ii) having the LLM generate entire templates, which often compromises intent clarity and reproductibility. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Embedded Jailbreak Template, which preserves the structure of existing templates while naturally embedding harmful queries within their context. We further propose a progressive prompt-engineering methodology to ensure template quality and consistency, alongside standardized protocols for generation and evaluation. Together, these contributions provide a benchmark that more accurately reflects real-world usage scenarios and harmful intent, facilitating its application in red-teaming and policy regression testing."

        "abstract": "To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy."

Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.\n  To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces."

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models."

Privis specifies a generalized transport-layer security architecture for volumetric media, defining core abstractions and adaptive protection mechanisms. We further explore a prototype implementation and present initial latency measurements to illustrate feasibility and design tradeoffs, providing early empirical guidance toward future work on real-time, saliency-conditioned secure delivery."

By turning the traditionally passive radio environment into a smart, programmable medium, metasurfaces promise advances in communication and sensing. However, metasurfaces also present a new security frontier: both attackers and defenders can exploit them to alter wireless propagation for their own advantage. While prior security research has primarily explored unilateral metasurface applications - empowering either attackers or defenders - this work investigates symmetric scenarios, where both sides possess comparable metasurface capabilities. Using both theoretical modeling and real-world experiments, we analyze how competing metasurfaces interact for diverse objectives, including signal power and sensing perception. Thereby, we present the first systematic study of context-agnostic metasurface-to-metasurface interactions and their implications for wireless security. Our results reveal that the outcome of metasurface \"battles\" depends on an interplay of timing, placement, algorithmic strategy, and hardware scale. Across multiple case studies in Wi-Fi environments, including wireless jamming, channel obfuscation for sensing and communication, and sensing spoofing, we demonstrate that opposing metasurfaces can substantially or fully negate each other's effects. By undermining previously proposed security and privacy schemes, our findings open new opportunities for designing resilient and high-assurance physical-layer systems in smart radio environments."

        "abstract": "Under real-analytic assumptions on decoder-only Transformers, recent work shows that the map from discrete prompts to last-token hidden states is generically injective on finite prompt sets. We refine this picture: for each layer $\\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $\u0394^\\ell \\subset \u0398$ and injective stratum $U^\\ell = \u0398\\setminus \u0394^\\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\\ell_\u03b8$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $\u0398/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.\n  We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training. Overall, the results suggest that Transformer representations are generically and persistently injective in the continuous-parameter idealization, while their practical invertibility can be probed using simple geometric diagnostics."

Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks.

We present Rebound, a general-purpose security framework that preserves rollback protection while enabling policy-authorized legitimate rollbacks of application binaries, configuration, and data. Key to Rebound is a reference monitor that mediates state transitions, enforces authorization policy, guarantees atomicity of state updates and rollbacks, and emits a tamper-evident log that provides transparency to applications and auditors.

In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \\lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks."

Moreover, existing defense methods typically involve training from scratch or fine-tuning using a large dataset without pinpointing the specific labels that are affected. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense."

These routers can exploit their own MLLMs to mine this data, violating user privacy. Existing privacy perturbations fail the critical dual challenge of this scenario: protecting PII from the router's MLLM while simultaneously preserving task utility for the agent's MLLM. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Task Adversarial Protector (DualTAP), a novel framework that, for the first time, explicitly decouples these conflicting objectives. DualTAP trains a lightweight generator using two key innovations: (i) a contrastive attention module that precisely identifies and targets only the PII-sensitive regions, and (ii) a dual-task adversarial objective that simultaneously minimizes a task-preservation loss (to maintain agent utility) and a privacy-interference loss (to suppress PII leakage). To facilitate this study, we introduce PrivScreen, a new dataset of annotated mobile screenshots designed specifically for this dual-task evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) demonstrate DualTAP's state-of-the-art protection. It reduces the average privacy leakage rate by 31.6 percentage points (a 3.0x relative improvement) while, critically, maintaining an 80.8% task success rate - a negligible drop from the 83.6% unprotected baseline. DualTAP presents the first viable solution to the privacy-utility trade-off in mobile MLLM agents."

        "abstract": "This study proposes a novel approach to ensure the security of textual data transmission in a semantic communication system. In the proposed system, a sender transmits textual information to a receiver, while a potential eavesdropper attempts to intercept the information. At the sender side, the text is initially preprocessed, where each sentence is annotated with its corresponding topic, and subsequently extracted into a knowledge graph. To achieve the secure transmission of the knowledge graph, we propose a channel encryption scheme that integrates constellation diagonal transformation with multi-parameter weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). At the receiver side, the textual data is first decrypted, and then recovered via a transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the probability of information compromise. The legitimate receiver achieves a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.9, whereas the BLEU score of the eavesdropper remains below 0.3. Compared to the baselines, the proposed method can improve the security by up to 20%."

However, its effectiveness is hindered by the presence of a non-resonant background that interferes with and distorts the true Raman signal. Deep learning methods have been employed to reconstruct the true Raman spectrum from measured CARS data using labeled datasets. A more recent development integrates the domain knowledge of Kramers-Kronig relationships and smoothness constraints in the form of physics-informed loss functions. However, these deterministic models lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, an essential feature for reliable deployment in high-stakes scientific and biomedical applications. In this work, we evaluate and compare various uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques within the context of CARS-to-Raman signal reconstruction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating physics-informed constraints into these models improves their calibration, offering a promising path toward more trustworthy CARS data analysis."

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning techniques not only improve the adaptability to diverse downstream tasks, but also mitigate adverse effects of model quantization. Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions."

We analyzed 183 backdoor defense papers published between 2018 and 2025 across major AI and security venues, examining the properties and evaluation methodologies of these defenses.\n  Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in experimental setups, evaluation metrics, and threat model assumptions in the literature. Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations.

In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations."

The benchmark introduces 15 corruption types at 5 severity levels across CASIA-B, CCPG, and SUSTech1K, with in-the-wild validation on MEVID, and evaluates six state-of-the-art gait systems. We came across several exciting insights. First, applying noise at the RGB level better reflects real-world degradation, and reveal how distortions propagate through silhouette extraction to the downstream gait recognition systems. Second, gait accuracy is highly sensitive to silhouette extractor biases, revealing an overlooked source of benchmark bias.

However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects."

While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types.\n  In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability."

While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs."

This paper introduces \"History Swapping,\" a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior."

In this work, we conduct the first study of backdoor attacks on OVODs and reveal a new attack surface introduced by prompt tuning. We propose TrAP (Trigger-Aware Prompt tuning), a multi-modal backdoor injection strategy that jointly optimizes prompt parameters in both image and text modalities along with visual triggers. TrAP enables the attacker to implant malicious behavior using lightweight, learnable prompt tokens without retraining the base model weights, thus preserving generalization while embedding a hidden backdoor. We adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively shrinks the trigger size, enabling effective backdoor activation using small trigger patches at inference. Experiments across multiple datasets show that TrAP achieves high attack success rates for both object misclassification and object disappearance attacks, while also improving clean image performance on downstream datasets compared to the zero-shot setting."

In a targeted data poisoning attack, an adversary manipulates the training dataset to alter the classification of a targeted test point. Given the typically large size of training dataset, manual detection of poisoning is difficult. An alternative is to automatically measure a dataset's robustness against such an attack, which is the focus of this paper. We consider a threat model wherein an adversary can only perturb the labels of the training dataset, with knowledge limited to the hypothesis space of the victim's model. In this setting, we prove that finding the robustness is an NP-Complete problem, even when hypotheses are linear classifiers. To overcome this, we present a technique that finds lower and upper bounds of robustness. Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail."

Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods.

Existing transparency mechanisms - including Model Cards, Datasheets, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) - advance provenance reporting but rarely provide verifiable, machine-readable evidence of model security. This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields. The AIRS Framework thus extends SBOM practice to the AI domain by coupling threat modeling with automated, auditable evidence generation, providing a principled foundation for standardized, trustworthy, and machine-verifiable AI risk documentation."

The design of backdoor triggers has evolved from fixed triggers to dynamic or implicit triggers. This increased flexibility in trigger design makes it challenging for defenders to identify their specific forms accurately. Most existing backdoor defense methods are limited to specific types of triggers or rely on an additional clean model for support. To address this issue, we propose a backdoor detection method based on attention similarity, enabling backdoor detection without prior knowledge of the trigger. Our study reveals that models subjected to backdoor attacks exhibit unusually high similarity among attention heads when exposed to triggers. Based on this observation, we propose an attention safety alignment approach combined with head-wise fine-tuning to rectify potentially contaminated attention heads, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of backdoor attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the success rate of backdoor attacks while preserving the model's performance on downstream tasks."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety."
