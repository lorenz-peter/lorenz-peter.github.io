        "abstract": "Autonomous Target Tracking (ATT) systems, especially ATT drones, are widely\nused in applications such as surveillance, border control, and law enforcement,\nwhile also being misused in stalking and destructive actions. Thus, the\nsecurity of ATT is highly critical for real-world applications. Under the\nscope, we present a new type of attack: distance-pulling attacks (DPA) and a\nsystematic study of it, which exploits vulnerabilities in ATT systems to\ndangerously reduce tracking distances, leading to drone capturing, increased\nsusceptibility to sensor attacks, or even physical collisions. To achieve these\ngoals, we present FlyTrap, a novel physical-world attack framework that employs\nan adversarial umbrella as a deployable and domain-specific attack vector.\nFlyTrap is specifically designed to meet key desired objectives in attacking\nATT drones: physical deployability, closed-loop effectiveness, and\nspatial-temporal consistency. Through novel progressive distance-pulling\nstrategy and controllable spatial-temporal consistency designs, FlyTrap\nmanipulates ATT drones in real-world setups to achieve significant system-level\nimpacts. Our evaluations include new datasets, metrics, and closed-loop\nexperiments on real-world white-box and even commercial ATT drones, including\nDJI and HoverAir. Results demonstrate FlyTrap's ability to reduce tracking\ndistances within the range to be captured, sensor attacked, or even directly\ncrashed, highlighting urgent security risks and practical implications for the\nsafe deployment of ATT systems."

        "abstract": "Decentralized resource markets are Web 3.0 applications that build\nopen-access platforms for trading digital resources among users without any\ncentral management. They promise cost reduction, transparency, and flexible\nservice provision. However, these markets usually have large workload that must\nbe processed in a timely manner, leading to serious scalability problems.\nDespite the large amount of work on blockchain scalability, existing solutions\nare ineffective as they do not account for these markets' work models and\ntraffic patterns.\n  We introduce chainScale, a secure hybrid sidechain-sharding solution that\naims to boost throughput of decentralized resource markets and reduce their\nlatency and storage footprint. At its core, chainScale leverages dependent\nsidechains and functionality-oriented workload splitting to parallelize traffic\nprocessing by having each market module assigned to a sidechain. Different from\nsharding, chainScale does not incur any cross-sidechain transactions that tend\nto be costly. chainScale introduces several techniques, including hierarchical\nworkload sharing that further sub-divides overloaded modules, and weighted\nminer assignment that assigns miners with vested interest in the system to\ncritical modules' sidechains. Furthermore, chainScale employs sidechain syncing\nto maintain the mainchain as the single truth of system state, and pruning to\ndiscard stale records. Beside analyzing security, we build a proof-of-concept\nimplementation for a distributed file storage market as a use case. Our\nexperiments show that, compared to a single sidechain-based prior solution,\nchainScale boosts throughput by 4x and reduces confirmation latency by 5x.\nAlso, they show that chainScale outperforms sharding by 2.5x in throughput and\n3.5x in latency."

At\nthe same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack\nsurfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or\ncontent of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to\nmanipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal\nframework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems.

        "abstract": "In recent years, various software supply chain (SSC) attacks have posed\nsignificant risks to the global community. Severe consequences may arise if\ndevelopers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks\ninto their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large\nlanguage models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community.\nHowever, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code,\nincluding fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data,\nall of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this\npaper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these\ninherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven\npotential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code,\nand continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in\nLLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows,\nwhile some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the\nsecurity of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and\nseverity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on\nSSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four\npopular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified\nSSC-related threats persistently exist.

        "abstract": "Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that\nundermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove\nsensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten\" information remains\nprecariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root\ncause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual\ndata points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss\nlandscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can\ndrastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks\nexploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate\nthe steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly\nrecovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical\nrobustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To\naddress this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided\noptimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via\nneighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses\nadversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering\nfeedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through\ngradient projection.

Existing\nattacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily\ntarget vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD\nsystems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)\nAdversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital\nlevel. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage\nAttack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on\noptimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate\nphysically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization\nacross different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the\nobserved vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA\nintroduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational\ndiscrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various\nVLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing\nstate-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\\% in 3-P metrics).

To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier\nPrompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature\nextraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality\nFusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts\nthrough multi-modal feature fusion.

        "abstract": "LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching\nalgorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align\nsensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to\nerrors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate\npose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is\ncrucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing\napproaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions.\nMoreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation\neither depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide\na binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to\nproperly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework\nthat leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of\nICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating\neach LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method\nenables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing\nlocalization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it\naccurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a\npre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness."

To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the\nfirst unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA\nmodels by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous\noptimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness\npresents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse\nphysical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining\nevaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios\nwithout prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address\nthe first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical\ndomains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination\nvariations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that\ndisrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a\ncontinuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical\nvariations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of\nworst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models\nacross multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types\ntrigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to\n97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks.

However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain\ncontradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering\nnoise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in\nvisual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper\nperspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and\nrecomposition problem.

Malicious participants can perform\nlabel flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt\nthe global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a\nnovel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse\nadversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA\ncombines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of\nclients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based\ngeometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client\nbased on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering\nof suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients,\ncountering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine\nfailures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+\nrecords) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse\nadversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves\nrobust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on\nNF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum,\nTrimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further\ndemonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the\nanomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%,\nrespectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach.\nThis demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated\nlearning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions."

This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust\nwhen operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater\nenvironments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive\nevaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated\nunderwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images\nfrom DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also\nanalyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges,\nand color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall\nperformance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and\ntexture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images.\nClass imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3)\nimage counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance,\nwhile object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we\nevaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection,\nwhich improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and\nfine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced\ndomains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong\npotential for domain adaptation, respectively.

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that\nare impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing\na novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or\nmore other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger\ntrajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the\nbehaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to\ngenerate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively\nrefined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training\nstrategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but\nare designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of\nthe attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through\nextensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents\nwith 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the\nflexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the\nunder-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such\ntrajectory-based backdoor attacks."

For example, Upstream's\n2024 Automotive Cybersecurity Report states that 49.5% of cyberattacks in the\nautomotive sector are related to exploiting security vulnerabilities in\nsoftware systems. In this chapter, we analyze security vulnerabilities in\nopen-source software components in AVs. We utilize static analyzers on popular\nopen-source AV software, such as Autoware, Apollo, and openpilot. Specifically,\nthis chapter covers: (1) prevalent software security vulnerabilities of AVs;\nand (2) a comparison of static analyzer outputs for different open-source AV\nrepositories. The goal is to inform researchers, practitioners, and\npolicymakers about the existing security flaws in the commonplace open-source\nsoftware ecosystem in the AV domain.

Action-based video object segmentation addresses this\nby linking segmentation with action semantics, but it depends on large-scale\nannotations and prompts that are costly, inconsistent, and prone to multimodal\nnoise such as imprecise masks and referential ambiguity. To date, this\nchallenge remains unexplored. In this work, we take the first step by studying\naction-based video object segmentation under label noise, focusing on two\nsources: textual prompt noise (category flips and within-category noun\nsubstitutions) and mask annotation noise (perturbed object boundaries to mimic\nimprecise supervision). Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce\ntwo types of label noises for the action-based video object segmentation task.\nSecond, we build up the first action-based video object segmentation under a\nlabel noise benchmark ActiSeg-NL and adapt six label-noise learning strategies\nto this setting, and establish protocols for evaluating them under textual,\nboundary, and mixed noise. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking\nnoise types to failure modes and robustness gains, and we introduce a Parallel\nMask Head Mechanism (PMHM) to address mask annotation noise. Qualitative\nevaluations further reveal characteristic failure modes, including boundary\nleakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional\nidentity substitutions under textual flips. Our comparative analysis reveals\nthat different learning strategies exhibit distinct robustness profiles,\ngoverned by a foreground-background trade-off where some achieve balanced\nperformance while others prioritize foreground accuracy at the cost of\nbackground precision.

Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a\npromising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause\noverfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a\npreliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC\nestimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and\noverestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo\nAnnotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning\nframework.

Prior works have demonstrated the growing capability of\ncryptanalytic attacks to scale to deeper models. In this paper, we present the\nfirst defense mechanism against cryptanalytic parameter extraction attacks. Our\nkey insight is to eliminate the neuron uniqueness necessary for these attacks\nto succeed. We achieve this by a novel, extraction-aware training method.\nSpecifically, we augment the standard loss function with an additional\nregularization term that minimizes the distance between neuron weights within a\nlayer. Therefore, the proposed defense has zero area-delay overhead during\ninference. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating\nextraction attacks while analyzing the model accuracy across different\narchitectures and datasets. When re-trained with the same model architecture,\nthe results show that our defense incurs a marginal accuracy change of less\nthan 1% with the modified loss function. Moreover, we present a theoretical\nframework to quantify the success probability of the attack.

This\nassumption overlooks a key characteristic of real-world adversaries: their\nresponsiveness, i.e., adversaries' ability to dynamically adjust their attack\nmodels based on the information of the target and its defenses. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a novel defense method that explicitly accounts for\nthe responsive nature of real-world adversaries via two methodological\ninnovations: a novel Responsive CPI attack and an attack-defense arms race\nframework. The former emulates the responsive behaviors of adversaries in the\nreal world, and the latter iteratively enhances both the target and attack\nmodels, ultimately producing a secure ML model that is robust against\nresponsive CPI attacks.

        "abstract": "Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of\nrecognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR\nover recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world\nvisual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and\npose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local\nIntegrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon\ntwo key insights: (i) learning an initial \\textit{coarse} alignment between\nvisual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content\nfacilitates the subsequent learning of \\textit{precise} visual-to-speech\nmappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain\nlocal regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues\nfor lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path\nfeature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features\nwithin a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the\nmodel learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding\nacoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a\ncoarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a\nContextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features\nwith relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,\nrefining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our\nframework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive\nlearning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual\nchallenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3\nbenchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced\nchallenging Mandarin dataset."

        "abstract": "Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a\nPretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual\nContinual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two\ncritical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name\nresults in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual\ndiversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual\nappearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework\nthat replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.\nSpecifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category\ndisambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic\nprototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to\nadaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive\nexperiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently\nenhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for\nlanguage-guided continual learning."

To address\nthis issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus\non mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label\npropagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples\nsometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking\nthe fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster\nProblem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification\nperformance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view\nsemi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an\nadversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the\ndistorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all\nsimilarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure\nfrom the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor\nlearning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the\ncomputational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm\ncombining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the\nformulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental\nresults on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, other vectors,\nsuch as network traffic analysis, remain relatively understudied, even though\nthey may pose significant threats to voter privacy and the overall\ntrustworthiness of the system.\n  In this paper, we examine how adversaries can exploit metadata from encrypted\nnetwork traffic to uncover sensitive information during online voting. Our\nanalysis reveals that, even without accessing the encrypted content, it is\npossible to infer critical voter actions, such as whether a person votes, the\nexact moment a ballot is submitted, and whether the ballot is valid or spoiled.\nWe test these attacks with both rule-based techniques and machine learning\nmethods. We evaluate our attacks on two widely used online voting platforms,\none proprietary and one partially open source, achieving classification\naccuracy as high as 99.5%. These results expose a significant privacy\nvulnerability that threatens key properties of secure elections, including\nvoter secrecy and protection against coercion or vote-buying.

This emerging threat has\nquickly attracted research attention, leading to various proposed attack\nvectors, such as hijacking Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers to access\nprivate data. However, most existing approaches lack stealth and persistence,\nlimiting their practical impact.\n  We propose the Cuckoo Attack, a novel attack that achieves stealthy and\npersistent command execution by embedding malicious payloads into configuration\nfiles. These files, commonly used in AI-IDEs, execute system commands during\nroutine operations, without displaying execution details to the user. Once\nconfigured, such files are rarely revisited unless an obvious runtime error\noccurs, creating a blind spot for attackers to exploit. We formalize our attack\nparadigm into two stages, including initial infection and persistence. Based on\nthese stages, we analyze the practicality of the attack execution process and\nidentify the relevant exploitation techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the\nimpact of Cuckoo Attack, which can not only invade the developer's local\ncomputer but also achieve supply chain attacks through the spread of\nconfiguration files.

        "abstract": "Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a foundational framework for supervised\nlearning but primarily optimizes average-case performance, often neglecting\nfairness and robustness considerations. Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization\n(TERM) extends ERM by introducing an exponential tilt hyperparameter $t$ to\nbalance average-case accuracy with worst-case fairness and robustness. However,\nin online or streaming settings where data arrive one sample at a time, the\nclassical TERM objective degenerates to standard ERM, losing tilt sensitivity.\nWe address this limitation by proposing an online TERM formulation that removes\nthe logarithm from the classical objective, preserving tilt effects without\nadditional computational or memory overhead. This formulation enables a\ncontinuous trade-off controlled by $t$, smoothly interpolating between ERM ($t\n\\to 0$), fairness emphasis ($t > 0$), and robustness to outliers ($t < 0$). We\nempirically validate online TERM on two representative streaming tasks: robust\nlinear regression with adversarial outliers and minority-class detection in\nbinary classification. Our results demonstrate that negative tilting\neffectively suppresses outlier influence, while positive tilting improves\nrecall with minimal impact on precision, all at per-sample computational cost\nequivalent to ERM. Online TERM thus recovers the full robustness-fairness\nspectrum of classical TERM in an efficient single-sample learning regime."

To address\nthese challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a\nMulti-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP\n(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation.

These high-level goals are then executed\nby the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational\nefficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness\nnear singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world\nenvironments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates\nand reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines.

To assess this, we\nintroduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along\nwith a new dataset, PERGData.

Our findings show that\ncurrent LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models\n(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously\nsuccessful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)\ncan fail more than 20% of the time.

Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks.

Initial access can be achieved\nby exploiting the BLE provisioning protocol which contains a critical command\ninjection vulnerability allowing root access via malformed Wi-Fi credentials,\nexploitable using hardcoded AES keys shared across all units. Partial reverse\nengineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static\nBlowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the\nsystem's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have\nobserved in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical\nrisk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse,\ncontinuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to\n43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator\nnotice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident\nCybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive\npreparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane,\ndemonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations.\nThese findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into\ncritical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape\nfuture security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems."

While generic\nobject detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes,\ntheir effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low\nobject-background separability. To address these limitations, this work\npresents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework\nthat integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection\ntechniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration\nintroduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion\nstrategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages\nlarge-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of\nreal-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions.\nThe contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically\nevaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across\nmultiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that\nintegrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades,\ncontributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising\nconfiguration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER\nfeatures derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR\nreduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8\npercentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline."

        "abstract": "Machine learning models used for distributed architectures consisting of\nservers and clients require large amounts of data to achieve high accuracy.\nData obtained from clients are collected on a central server for model\ntraining. However, storing data on a central server raises concerns about\nsecurity and privacy. To address this issue, a federated learning architecture\nhas been proposed. In federated learning, each client trains a local model\nusing its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the\ncentral server. The server then combines the received models using federated\naggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is\ndistributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical\nmanner. Although preventing data from leaving the clients enhances security,\ncertain concerns still remain. Attackers can perform inference attacks on the\nobtained models to approximate the training dataset, potentially causing data\nleakage. In this study, differential privacy was applied to address the\naforementioned security vulnerability, and a performance analysis was\nconducted. The Data-Unaware Classification Based on Association (duCBA)\nalgorithm was used as the federated aggregation method. Differential privacy\nwas implemented on the data using the Randomized Response technique, and the\ntrade-off between security and performance was examined under different epsilon\nvalues. As the epsilon value decreased, the model accuracy declined, and class\nprediction imbalances were observed. This indicates that higher levels of\nprivacy do not always lead to practical outcomes and that the balance between\nsecurity and performance must be carefully considered."

In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation\nemerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial\nnoise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby\nexposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we\nformalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder\nexisting approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation\nnamed AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the\n\"purification-customization\" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)\nPatch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over\nhigh-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep\nGuidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different\ntimesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible\nperturbations that persist under representative purification settings,\nachieving effective post-customization distortion.

In parallel, numerous schemes focus on\nimproving DNS security without modifying its fundamental two-stage structure.\nThese efforts highlight the feasibility of addressing DNS security as two\ndistinct but compatible stages. We survey DNS resolution process attacks and\nthreats and develop a comprehensive threat model and attack taxonomy for their\nsystematic categorization.

Recent weakly supervised\nmethods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as\nsegmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function.\nHowever, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their\npractical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of\nvisual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical\nimage registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to\nenhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image\ndatasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather\nthan using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline\nusing SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings,\nenabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation\npatterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the\nembedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide\ncoarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration\nand inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance\nimprovements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset.

This contrasts with computationally secure schemes, where\nsecurity claims are only asymptotic (i.e., under standard complexity\nassumptions, one only knows that $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ as the key size grows, but\nhas no explicit bound). Here we explain the definition and interpretation of\n$\\varepsilon$-security.

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial\nattacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness."

To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature\nAlignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a\nhierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),\nKnowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS).

This establishes rich and\nefficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of\nlinguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature\nalignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies\nmultimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct\na unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range\ncross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.\nFinally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided\nSemantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation\nintroduced in earlier stages."

Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests.

Various means to boost ML's adversarial\nrobustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair\nrobustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than\nfrom others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial\nrobustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has\nfocused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight\nis that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as\nface recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,\nleading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable\nbecause class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.\nAdditionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces\nsymmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions\nwhere group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to\nencourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively\nevaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including\nagainst targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR\nsignificantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across\nruns.

        "abstract": "The STIR/SHAKEN (S/S) attestation Framework mandated by the United States,\nCanada, and France to combat pervasive telephone abuse has not achieved its\ngoals, partly because legacy non-VoIP infrastructure could not participate. The\nindustry solution to extend S/S broadcasts sensitive metadata of every non-VoIP\ncall in plaintext to every third party required to facilitate the system. It\nhas no mechanism to determine whether a provider's request for call data is\nappropriate, nor can it ensure that every copy of that call data is unavailable\nafter its specified expiration. It threatens subscriber privacy and provider\nconfidentiality.\n  In this paper, we present Sidecar, a distributed, privacy-preserving system\nwith tunable decentralization that securely extends S/S across all telephone\nnetwork technologies. We introduce the notion of secure out-of-band signaling\nfor telephony and formalize its system and security requirements. We then\ndesign novel, scalable protocols that realize these requirements and prove\ntheir security within the Universal Composability framework. Finally, we\ndemonstrate Sidecar's efficiency with our open-sourced reference\nimplementation. Compared to the current solution, Sidecar 1) protects the\nconfidentiality of subscriber identity and provider trade secrets, 2)\nguarantees record expiration as long as a single node handling a record is\nhonest, 3) reduces resource requirements while providing virtually identical\ncall-setup times and equivalent or better uptimes, and 4) enables secure\npay-per-use billing and integrates mechanisms to mitigate and detect\nmisbehavior. Moreover, Sidecar can be extended to provide the same security\nguarantees for arbitrary call metadata. Not only is Sidecar a superior\napproach, it is also a transformative tool to retrofit fragmented global\ntelephony and enable future improvements, such as stronger call authentication\nand Branded Calling."

RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as\nunbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak\ngeneralization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive\nSemantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level\nmasks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the\nnetwork to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various\ndegradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning\nstrategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the\nintegrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while\nretaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy\nthat leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant\nrepresentations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful\nand semantically coherent restoration.

In this paper, we propose an\nadversarial attack approach based on Deep Q-Network and a heuristic\nbacktracking search strategy, which can generate perturbation sequences that\nsatisfy practical conditions for successful attacks. Subsequently, we utilize a\nnovel transformation approach that maps modifications back to the source code,\nthereby avoiding the need to directly modify the behavior log sequences. We\nconduct an evaluation of our approach, and the results confirm its\neffectiveness in generating adversarial samples from real-world malware\nbehavior sequences, which have a high success rate in evading anomaly detection\nmodels. Furthermore, our approach is practical and can generate adversarial\nsamples while maintaining the functionality of the modified software."

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has drawn urgent\nattention to the task of machine-generated text detection (MGTD). However,\nexisting approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot\ndetectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while\ntraining-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training\ndata, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of\ntraining-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective\nand task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL),\na novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with\ntask-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core\nsemantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and\ngeneralization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection\nframework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs.\nTo ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse\nmulti-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora\nacross 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17\ncutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual\nstyles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing\nmethods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently\noutperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same\ntraining data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our\nDDL.

Creating a profile of cyber threat actors based\non their traits or patterns of behavior can help to create effective defenses\nagainst cyberattacks in advance.
