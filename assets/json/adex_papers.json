        "abstract": "Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated\nfor radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various\nresearchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature\nperturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the\nperformance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among\nvarious kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has\ngained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,\nhence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a\nhigh success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system\ncalled neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial\nperturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal\nadversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is\nable to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher\naccuracy than the undefended deep neural network."

We have shown that\ntransformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible\nand carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we\npropose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based\nmodulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient\narchitecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or\noperation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a\ncompact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust\ntraining such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in\ncompact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact\ntransformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.\nThe new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the\nrobustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box\nscenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent\nattacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and\ninvestigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different\narchitectures.

        "abstract": "A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their\nreliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the\ncompounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training\nset, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This\nmismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep\nlearning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the\nscarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of\nexperimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving\nreliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nmeta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate\nbetween in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the\nmodel to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution.

Despite their promise, the\nrobustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely\nunexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes\nscenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study\nevaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three\ndimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement\nstate-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess\nmodel resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from\ndiverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to\ntext attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's\ntextual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods\ncan significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the\ncandidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.\nBeyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques\ntailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial\ntraining, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of\nGraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,\nequitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field."

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse\ndomains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted\ntraining data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit\nassumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which\ncan be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of\nmachine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates\nattribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and\ntargeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach\nemploys gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish\nhigh-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing\nrestrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based\nsensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to\nnoise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data\nsubset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This\nintegrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over\nconventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level\nunlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full\nmodel retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on\nrepresentative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech\nrecognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both\naccuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a\n10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with\ninjected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some\nsettings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the\nproposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments."

In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based\nEdge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.\nKCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the\ngraph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error\nbound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the\nchange in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically\nintroduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful\neffects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly\nintegrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without\nrequiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a\nprincipled and efficient solution for securing GNNs."

In this paper, we offer a new perspective on\nachieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established\ntechniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints\npenalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained\nRL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable\nactions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.\nFurthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through\npenalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely\nby an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This\nreformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving\nresilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between\nentropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further\nempirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL\nthrough simple reward shaping."

        "abstract": "Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine\nlearning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations\nsuch as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute\nsensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a\nscalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome\nthese obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically\ngenerate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude\nencoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands\nrepresentation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural\nTangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,\nuniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights\ndemonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to\nquantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational\nadvantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum\narchitectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through\nextensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge\nstates and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating\nresilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This\nresearch establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,\nadvancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional\ncomputing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond."

Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with\nthe data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It\nleverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian\nMixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive\nperformance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD\nscenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further\nillustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone\nclustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and\nregret precision."

KLJN's security, grounded\nin the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental\nand radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions\nof satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to\nintegrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a\nrevolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient\nsatellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving\nunconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks\nwhich address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats,\nincluding quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to\nunconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential\nuse of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for\nsecurity, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental\nsensitivity.

Although\nseveral works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their\nopen-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance\nand may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E\nautonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over\nthe tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E\npipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of\nbasis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving\nscenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer\nthe future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in\nsource-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,\nwithout requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust\nadaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct\nfinetuning.

As the\ngeneralization errors reflect the scalability of trained models on unseen data\nand are crucial in determining the performance of trained models in real-world\napplications, understanding the generalization errors of decentralized learning\nis of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained\ngeneralization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient\ndecentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild\nassumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or\nrely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed\nlight on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic\ngradient noise -- factors that have not been closely investigated before -- on\nthe generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that\nByzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the\ngeneralization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the\ndata heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical\nexperiments on both convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our\ntheoretical findings."

This paper explores the underlying\nfactors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for\ndifferent classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical\nobservation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we\npropose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge\nDistillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.\nSpecifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between\ndifferent classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness\ndegree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment\nis managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.\nAdditionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be\nintegrated with the sample-based methods.

This\nrigidity limits their practicality in dynamic environments like autonomous\ndriving, where traffic conditions and attack goals can change rapidly. For\nexample, if no obstacles are present around the target vehicle, the attack may\nfail to cause meaningful consequences.\n  To overcome this limitation, we propose SwitchPatch, a novel PAP that is\nstatic yet enables dynamic and controllable attack outcomes based on real-time\nscenarios. Attackers can alter pre-defined conditions, e.g., by projecting\ndifferent natural-color lights onto SwitchPatch to seamlessly switch between\nattack goals. Unlike prior work, SwitchPatch does not require re-generation or\nre-deployment for different objectives, significantly reducing cost and\ncomplexity. Furthermore, SwitchPatch remains benign when the enabling\nconditions are absent, enhancing its stealth.\n  We evaluate SwitchPatch on two key tasks: traffic sign recognition\n(classification and detection) and depth estimation. First, we conduct\ntheoretical analysis and empirical studies to demonstrate the feasibility of\nSwitchPatch and explore how many goals it can support using techniques like\ncolor light projection and occlusion.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments.

Comparative analysis of structural\nfeature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical\nregularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the\nconformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the\nProtein Data Bank (PDB).

        "abstract": "The explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has revolutionized digital\nownership by enabling the creation, exchange, and monetization of unique assets\non blockchain networks. However, this surge in popularity has also given rise\nto a disturbing trend: the emergence of rug pulls - fraudulent schemes where\ndevelopers exploit trust and smart contract privileges to drain user funds or\ninvalidate asset ownership. Central to many of these scams are hidden backdoors\nembedded within NFT smart contracts. Unlike unintentional bugs, these backdoors\nare deliberately coded and often obfuscated to bypass traditional audits and\nexploit investor confidence. In this paper, we present a large-scale static\nanalysis of 49,940 verified NFT smart contracts using Slither, a static\nanalysis framework, to uncover latent vulnerabilities commonly linked to rug\npulls. We introduce a custom risk scoring model that classifies contracts into\nhigh, medium, or low risk tiers based on the presence and severity of rug pull\nindicators. Our dataset was derived from verified contracts on the Ethereum\nmainnet, and we generate multiple visualizations to highlight red flag\nclusters, issue prevalence, and co-occurrence of critical vulnerabilities.\nWhile we do not perform live exploits, our results reveal how malicious\npatterns often missed by simple reviews can be surfaced through static analysis\nat scale. We conclude by offering mitigation strategies for developers,\nmarketplaces, and auditors to enhance smart contract security. By exposing how\nhidden backdoors manifest in real-world smart contracts, this work contributes\na practical foundation for detecting and mitigating NFT rug pulls through\nscalable automated analysis."

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndistributed clients without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach\nfor privacy-preserving machine learning in domains like Connected and\nAutonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, recent studies have shown that exchanged\nmodel gradients remain susceptible to inference attacks such as Deep Leakage\nfrom Gradients (DLG), which can reconstruct private training data. While\nexisting defenses like Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Multi-Party\nComputation (SMPC) offer protection, they often compromise model accuracy. To\nthat end, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a promising alternative by\nenabling lossless computation directly on encrypted data, thereby preserving\nboth privacy and model utility. However, HE introduces significant\ncomputational and communication overhead, which can hinder its practical\nadoption. To address this, we systematically evaluate various leveled HE\nschemes to identify the most suitable for FL in resource-constrained\nenvironments due to its ability to support fixed-depth computations without\nrequiring costly bootstrapping. Our contributions in this paper include a\ncomprehensive evaluation of HE schemes for real-world FL applications, a\nselective encryption strategy that targets only the most sensitive gradients to\nminimize computational overhead, and the development of a full HE-based FL\npipeline that effectively mitigates DLG attacks while preserving model\naccuracy. We open-source our implementation to encourage reproducibility and\nfacilitate adoption in safety-critical domains."

        "abstract": "Recent works have started to theoretically investigate how we can protect\ndifferentially private programs against timing attacks, by making the joint\ndistribution the output and the runtime differentially private (JOT-DP).\nHowever, the existing approaches to JOT-DP have some limitations, particularly\nin the setting of unbounded DP (which protects the size of the dataset and\napplies to arbitrarily large datasets). First, the known conversion of pure DP\nprograms to pure JOT-DP programs in the unbounded setting (a) incurs a constant\nadditive increase in error probability (and thus does not provide vanishing\nerror as $n\\to\\infty$) (b) produces JOT-DP programs that fail to preserve the\ncomputational efficiency of the original pure DP program and (c) is analyzed in\na toy computational model in which the runtime is defined to be the number of\ncoin flips. In this work, we overcome these limitations. Specifically, we show\nthat the error required for pure JOT-DP in the unbounded setting depends on the\nmodel of computation. In a randomized RAM model where the dataset size $n$ is\ngiven (or can be computed in constant time) and we can generate random numbers\n(not just random bits) in constant time, polynomially small error probability\nis necessary and sufficient. If $n$ is not given or we only have a random-bit\ngenerator, an (arbitrarily small) constant error probability is necessary and\nsufficient. The aforementioned positive results are proven by efficient\nprocedures to convert any pure JOT-DP program $P$ in the upper-bounded setting\nto a pure JOT-DP program $P'$ in the unbounded setting, such that the output\ndistribution of $P'$ is $\\gamma$-close in total variation distance to that of\n$P$, where $\\gamma$ is either an arbitrarily small constant or polynomially\nsmall, depending on the model of computation."

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely employed, and its usage is\ngrowing exponentially because it facilitates remote monitoring, predictive\nmaintenance, and data-driven decision making, especially in the healthcare and\nindustrial sectors. However, IoT devices remain vulnerable due to their\nresource constraints and difficulty in applying security patches. Consequently,\nvarious cybersecurity attacks are reported daily, such as Denial of Service,\nparticularly in IoT-driven solutions. Most attack detection methodologies are\nbased on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can detect attack patterns.\nHowever, the focus is more on identification rather than considering the impact\nof ML algorithms on computational resources. This paper proposes a green\nmethodology to identify IoT malware networking attacks based on flow\nprivacy-preserving statistical features. In particular, the hyperparameters of\nthree tree-based models -- Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra-Trees -- are\noptimized based on energy consumption and test-time performance in terms of\nMatthew's Correlation Coefficient.

Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT\n(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel\nconformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA\nattack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for\nvarious defenses.

This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to\ninternalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over\nunseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios.

Traditional static or centralized defense\nmechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework\nfor proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,\nwe design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader\nswitching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent\nflexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network\nresilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,\nresource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV\nis equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions\nbased on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy\ngradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense\npolicies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without\nsharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack\nmitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and\ndecreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,\nrespectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS\nattack strategies."

Recent\nadvances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.\n2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build\nhighly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that\nachieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically\nexplore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:\nSharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced\nattention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid\nneural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework\nwith specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across\nnine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject\nseries, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly\nintroduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on\nchallenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our\narchitectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large\ndecoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance\ntrade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while\nRaudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each\narchitecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and\nresource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance\nof complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications."

Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that\nleverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this\ninsight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data\npoisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning\nimage-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a\ndataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object\nattributes.

Our detailed analysis\nusing attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on\nsemantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining\nnormal behavior on clean inputs.

We find that previous approaches to\nred-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue\ndiversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding\nsimilarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.\nSecond, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts\ncoverage across potential attack styles and risk categories.

QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through\nbehavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an\nopen-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers\ncapable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk\ncategories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks\nthat are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target\nLLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5.

In\norder to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features\nextracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and\ntemporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision\nlimitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep\nresidual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model\nincorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth\nleaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF).

Yet, a core question remains: do these models\ntruly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this\npaper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate\nthe robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically\nfaithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation --\nspanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems --\napplies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint\ninjection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while\ncertain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to\n-42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting\nsensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics.\nThese findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning\nsystems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning\nalignments and prompting robustness.

Most existing methods assume that all\nqueries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric\ncosts; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may\ntrigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly\nthan others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,\neffective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative\nvariant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and\nAsymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution\nto favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes.

These attacks can compromise the\nsemantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing\ndefense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named\nKNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and\nnearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface\ngeometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores\nperturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples\nfrom the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally\nefficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and\npractical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset\ndemonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various\nattack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing\nmethods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the\nproposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on\nPointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively.

        "abstract": "Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and\nlow-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by\nrequesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries.\nBecause individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to\n{detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the\nattacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against\nsuch strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data\ngeneration pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and\ncorresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that\nare consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker\nopen-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are\neffective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure."

Existing\npoisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages\nas disjointed, limiting their effectiveness.

While optimized under a\nwhite-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability\nto unseen models.

        "abstract": "As satellite systems become increasingly vulnerable to physical layer attacks\nvia SDRs, novel countermeasures are being developed to protect critical\nsystems, particularly those lacking cryptographic protection, or those which\ncannot be upgraded to support modern cryptography. Among these is transmitter\nfingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be\nauthenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as\nimpairments on the signal.\n  Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite\ntransmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple\nreplay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks\ndirectly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for\nmaximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and\ndemonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium\ntransmitters. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error\nrate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than\ntraditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during\nspoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own\ntransmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a data poisoning\nattack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering the data used to\nauthenticate incoming messages to include the fingerprint of the attacker's\ntransmitter.\n  Finally, we show that our model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also\nbe used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the\nattacker's transmitter before. Furthermore, this technique works even when the\ntraining dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to\nbe used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites,\nproviding additional protection where it is needed the most."

In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected\nto the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled\nby a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this\npaper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be\ndifferent. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should\nbe injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new\nframework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).\nSpecifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data\npoint deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,\nbased on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to\nadaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise\ninjections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods\nresults in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10\nand ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels\nto different samples in DBP methods.

These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse\nconditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as\nmeaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical\napplications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable\nenvironments and avoid sudden failures at all costs.

For systems without\nanalytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation\nstrategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of\nlow-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,\nfacilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a\nclosure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.\nHere we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the\nunclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared\nto physical-expert-derived ODE models.

Moreover,\nwe provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under\nproperly selected step size and scaling parameter $\\sigma$, the decentralized\nrobust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)\nin both norms.

        "abstract": "In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various\nimportant foundation models to predict their properties and performance at\nlarger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate\ncheckpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\\%$ zero-shot\nImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B.

Despite significant advancements, fact-checking\nsystems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle\nadversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge\nfact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free\nmethod designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate\nsupporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into\nthree steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments\nadversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval\nand Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim\nbased on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction\nthat aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.\nExperiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our\nframework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label\naccuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines."

TRIDENT leverages multilingual\nback-translation to introduce semantic variance, character-level noise, and\nentity obfuscation for differential privacy enforcement, and combines these\ntechniques into a unified defense mechanism. Using a binary propaganda\nclassification dataset, baseline transformer models (BERT, GPT-2) we achieved\nF1 scores of 0.89 and 0.90.

The extended ODXU\nincorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)\nand metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to\nassess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017\ndataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six\nevaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.\nWhile transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer\nvision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not\nbeen thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning\nstrategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different\ndataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal\ntransfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining\nthe clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms\ntraditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples\n(approximately 50% of the training data).

To simultaneously enhance privacy and training\nefficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale\npretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a\npretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight\nmodules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.\nAccordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are\nshared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the\nfine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the\npretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient\ninversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an\nattacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the\naccessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a\nlarge batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity.

To counteract the\ninherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images\nis a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the\npresented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually\nevaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness\nis often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial\neffort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work,\nwe tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of\nAI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of\nAI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable\nadversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an\nensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four\ndifferent text-to-image models.

        "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in\nmultimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a\nsignificant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite\noften being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter\nmodel outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper\nintroduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can\neffectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding\nminimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its\nlatent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP\ncumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input\ndata. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy\nimages reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach\nto neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion\nmodel is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean\nrepresentation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive\nexperiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths\nin three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing\ndefense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly\nreduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time,\nthereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical\nand empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for\nsecurely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments."
