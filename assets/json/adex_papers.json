        "abstract": "The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised\nseveral risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data\nstewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers\nhave created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or\npart of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish\nthat data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on\nhigh-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and\ndesigned prompts.\n  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes\nlittle to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,\nbenign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This\nhighlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed\nuser and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one\nexisting model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a\nreal-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works\nwhich leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability\nthat stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where\ntemplated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts."

In\nthis work, we conduct the first comprehensive survey of hardware-backed key\nstorage in Android devices.

Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and\nmorphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face\nchallenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and\nlack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel\nsemi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based\ntoolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,\nachieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with\nminimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based\nlandmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively\naddressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human\nsubjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved\nsensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing\nsemi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative\nfeature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework\nutilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for\nspecific artery types.

We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N\n= 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually\ngenerated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nand Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and\ncounterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate)\nand perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity). The results indicate that\nwell-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually\ncrafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated\nwarnings exhibited particularly robust performance. Feature-based explanations\nwere more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual\nexplanations diminished false-positive rates.

Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

        "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine\ninteractions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile\nphones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks\nin a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,\nthe injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,\ne.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor\nattack risks in GUI agents."

At the same\ntime, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point\ninstrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under\nsingle-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order\nMemory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency\nfault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ\n(Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual\nfractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and\nGr\\\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and\nslow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then\npinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch,\neffectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened\nthrough Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose\nattack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining\n(OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a\nfour-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under\nfour attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0\n% (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining\n96.7 % under attack-free conditions.

In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack\nframework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on\nperceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.\nSpecifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by\nleveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the\nsusceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human\nvisual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a\ngradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible\nperturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and\nmodel architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive\nattack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch\ninvisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly\nimperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several\nstate-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective."

        "abstract": "Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack\nmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm\nperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual\ncapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based\napproaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to\ninstability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on\ndiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable\nadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution\ntowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map\nto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated\nsamples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of\nnatural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but\nalso retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA\ndatasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in\nboth black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv\nachieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,\nthe dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables\nScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures."

While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings.

In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs.

Existing approaches\ntreat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying\ncausal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from\nthese interventions.

Detecting and sifting out poisoned\ndata is an important method to prevent data poisoning attacks.

We introduce the unique speedup\nof quantum computing for the first time in the task of detecting data\npoisoning. We present Q-Detection, a quantum-classical hybrid defense method\nfor detecting poisoning attacks. Q-Detection also introduces the Q-WAN, which\nis optimized using quantum computing devices. Experimental results using\nmultiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends\nagainst label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that\nQ-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to\nthe state-of-the-art.

Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological\nresearch as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive\nmodels. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:\nPersonality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences\nreverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely\nwith trivial rephrasing. These \"measurement phantoms\"--statistical artifacts\nmasquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing\nbody of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates\npsychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that\nscales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text\nrequires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological\nproperties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)\nexplicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,\n(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric\ntesting, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)\nexecute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate\nfor non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated\nboundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through\nan example of model evaluation--\"LLM selfhood\"--showing how systematic\nvalidation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement\nartifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent\npractices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical\nfoundation for AI psychology research."

Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling.

As a concrete step toward improving evaluation\nreliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess\nthe effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible\nconditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack\nimplementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers\nand practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in\nsubsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing\nconditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for\nrobustness verification."

Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs\nthe performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by\nestimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such\nresource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet\nrealistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that\nseeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.\nSpecifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning\nframework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned\nnoisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,\nwhich can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and\nfalse negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one\nunified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our\napproach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.\nRemarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer\nwhile with lower computational overhead.

To remedy this problem,\nwe attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various\nattacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low\nentropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on\nthe universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is\nelaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.\n2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower\nentropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark\ncontrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct\nexisting test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:\nRectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial\nrectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with\nclean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified\nwith low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating\ntheir adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly\nclassified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward\nminimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization\nscheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware\nweighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy\nobjectives.

The Rust\ncompiler is unable to statically enforce Rust principles in mixed Rust code\nwhich can lead to many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose\nCapsLock, a security enforcement mechanism that can run at the level of machine\ncode and detect Rust principle violations at run-time in mixed code. CapsLock\nis kept simple enough to be implemented into recent capability-based hardware\nabstractions that provide low-cost spatial memory safety. CapsLock introduces a\nnovel revoke-on-use abstraction for capability-based designs, wherein accessing\na memory object via a capability implicitly invalidates certain other\ncapabilities pointing to it, thereby also providing temporal memory safety\nautomatically, without requiring software to explicitly specify such\ninvalidation. Thus, CapsLock is the first mechanism capable of providing\ncross-language enforcement of Rust principles. We implemented a prototype of\nCapsLock on QEMU. Evaluation results show that CapsLock is highly compatible\nwith existing Rust code (passing 99.7% of the built-in test cases of the 100\nmost popular crates) and flags Rust principle violations in real-world Rust\nprojects that use FFI or inline assembly.

We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a\ntailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a\ncomparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on\nLlama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and\nweight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization\nsignificantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high\nsuccess (>80% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack budget\nof 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20% and 50%,\nrespectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8\nmodels maintained ASR below 65%, demonstrating some resilience compared to INT8\nand INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation\nlocations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,\nwith (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics.

Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than\nshape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract\nshapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a\nsolution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than\nscaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early\ninfancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising\ndecades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel\ndevelopmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems\nthrough this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with\nhuman behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the\nstrongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape\nrecognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image\ncorruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks.

        "abstract": "Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,\nwhere metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading\nthe way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design\nstrategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor\nout-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for\nforward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the\nMetamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation\nmodel inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics\nof metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,\nunseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also\nexcels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating\nmetamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural\nresponses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and\nsignificantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable\nframework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving\nthe way for next-generation innovations."

To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,\na modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,\nexplanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent\norchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to\na distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and\n(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a\ndomain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and\nself-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic\ndesign that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This\nagent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language\njustifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing\ninterpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be\nsupported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.\nCyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing\nfinal classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.\nGenerated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based\nexpert evaluation.

Accurate\nkinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally\nachieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small\nanimals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,\nprecluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully\nconvolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions\ndirectly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling\nin dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial\nfeature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,\nextracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a\ntemporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The\nproposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood\ncurves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model\napplicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected\nusing two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The\nmodel was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate\nshorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts\nthe arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.\nFurthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function\neven from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF\nfrom samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not\nrepresented in the training data.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios.

        "abstract": "Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious\nfacial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.\nOur code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark."

We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon*\nthat addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol\nimplementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split\nallows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the\nsecurity-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the\nverification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot\ninvalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses\nachieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations\nwithin the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data\n(such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have\nproved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application\nto perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual\nverification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two\ncase studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a\nlarge (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol\nfor which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a\nCore of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in\nless than three person months."

Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim\nmodels, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while\nmaintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the\nsusceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel\nbackdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed\nBadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency\nsensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed\ntriggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss\nthat strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by\naligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack\nsuccess rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits\nremarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop,\nPatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor\nattacks."

Via an\nontological analysis grounded in the Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER)\n-- a reference core ontology based on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)\n-- we investigate the ontological adequacy of AT and reveal four significant\nshortcomings: (1) ambiguous syntactical terms that can be interpreted in\nvarious ways; (2) ontological deficit concerning crucial domain-specific\nconcepts; (3) lacking modeling guidance to construct ATs decomposing a goal;\n(4) lack of semantic interoperability, resulting in ad hoc stand-alone tools.\nWe also discuss existing incremental solutions and how our analysis paves the\nway for overcoming those issues through a broader approach to risk management\nmodeling."

Rather than\nmodifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --\nrepresented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to\ngenerate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as\nit ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as\ninstances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from\nthis concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain\nthe original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby\nmisleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent\nwith traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical\nand empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield\nmore diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying\nconcept, while achieving higher attack efficiency."

For example, many variants of data poisoning attacks produce gradient\nvectors during training that are outliers in the distribution of clean\ngradients, which bias the computed average used to derive the ML model.\nFiltering them out before averaging serves as a generic defense strategy.\nByzantine robust aggregation is an algorithmic primitive which computes a\nrobust average of vectors, in the presence of an $\\epsilon$ fraction of vectors\nwhich may have been arbitrarily and adaptively corrupted, such that the\nresulting bias in the final average is provably bounded.\n  In this paper, we give the first robust aggregator that runs in quasi-linear\ntime in the size of input vectors and provably has near-optimal bias bounds.\nOur algorithm also does not assume any knowledge of the distribution of clean\nvectors, nor does it require pre-computing any filtering thresholds from it.\nThis makes it practical to use directly in standard neural network training\nprocedures. We empirically confirm its expected runtime efficiency and its\neffectiveness in nullifying 10 different ML poisoning attacks."

The\nnewly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows\nlearning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees\nunder epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy\noptimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making\nuse of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser)\nand the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian\nrepresenting a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance\nas a Bregman divergence, and an $\\mathcal{O}\\left(e^{-T}\\right)$ convergence\nrate for entropy-regularised objectives.

        "abstract": "Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,\nyet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,\ngeneralizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding\nparadigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel\nsegments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during\ntransmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the\nCORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,\nCoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters\nwith stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By\nmodifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the\nselected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a\ngeneral plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can\nadaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the\nembedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation\nindicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across\nmultiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves\nsignificant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera\nattacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility."

As an application of our framework, we propose a new approach to\nbuild zero-knowledge protocols where security holds even against a verifier\nthat can obtain a superposition of transcripts.

In this work we revisit this problem, and present two new\nthree-round protocols in the common reference string model: (i) A\nzero-knowledge argument for NP, whose security reduces to the standard learning\nwith errors (LWE) problem.

        "abstract": "Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for\nmulti-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple\nagents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception\nperformance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs\nto receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to\nattacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which\nis a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately\ndetect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code\nwill be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-Guard"
