        "abstract": "With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world\napplications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this\nsetting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates\ncontextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically\ngenerating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric\njailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic\ntoxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt\nthat reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.\nSpecifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success\nRate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming\nthe baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

To this end, we\ndevelop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in\nmodel-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We\nprovide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved\nversion of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7\nsecurity benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic\ninstruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,\nincluding tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general\ninstruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves\nstate-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable\nutility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense."

        "abstract": "The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of\nLLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources\nto support complex task execution. Among these, LLM email agent apps represent\none of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication\nmedium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to\nemail using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions\nvia external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing\ndeployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains\nunderexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential\nsecurity risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of\nLLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which\noverrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources,\nallowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further\nperform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.\n  To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to\nevaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an\nempirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps,\n12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world\nemail agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all\n1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack\nattempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some\nLLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops\nto as few as 1.23."

        "abstract": "The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks\nemphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures\nsuch as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of\nattack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms\nthat can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of\nML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on\nimplementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and\nethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack\nscenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective\nmethods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper\npresents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and\ncorresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,\nrepresenting various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,\nspoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack\nmodels augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to\nconfigure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and\npromote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated\nattack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,\nin which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural\nnetwork IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and\nscalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high\ndetection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and\neffectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also\nelaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world\nscenarios and provide insights into its application."

        "abstract": "Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on\nsupervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.\nHowever, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.\nMoreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting\nwell-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a\nZero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,\nwithout requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong\ngeneralization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring\nillumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising\nmodule. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection\ncomponents via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances\nnon-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive\ncorrection method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined\niteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public\ndatasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under\ncomplex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR\n(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art\nunsupervised methods. The code will be released soon."

To address these limitations, we introduce the\nMetamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation\nmodel inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics\nof metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,\nunseen combinations of material properties and structural responses.

To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,\na modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,\nexplanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent\norchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to\na distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and\n(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a\ndomain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and\nself-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic\ndesign that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This\nagent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language\njustifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing\ninterpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be\nsupported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.\nCyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing\nfinal classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.\nGenerated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based\nexpert evaluation.

Accurate\nkinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally\nachieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small\nanimals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,\nprecluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully\nconvolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions\ndirectly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling\nin dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial\nfeature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,\nextracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a\ntemporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The\nproposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood\ncurves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model\napplicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected\nusing two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The\nmodel was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate\nshorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts\nthe arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.\nFurthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function\neven from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF\nfrom samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not\nrepresented in the training data.

Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor\nattacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured\nin the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the\nfirst system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition\nsystems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of\nDNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the\nfirst time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and\nface landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained\nwith large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our\nmodels, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack\ncases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function\nof a system.

First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation.

However, the inherent noise\nin both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to\nover-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To\naddress this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that\nintegrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,\n30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.\nOur framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding\nstrategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to\nenhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion\nmodule that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via\nhierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions\ninherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation\ntechnique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training\nexamples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in\npredictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.\n  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for\nhuman-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation\naccuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%."

Finally, we examine the\nrobustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned\napproach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of\nout-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby\npromoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from\nexperimental radiographic images."

To\nevaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures\nenvironmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during\nwell-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first\nanalyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation\nthrough personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of\nthese services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software\nenvironmental impact assessment. We apply our framework to three mainstream\nemail services selected to reflect different privacy policies, from\nad-supported tracking-intensive models to privacy-focused designs: Microsoft\nOutlook, Google Mail (Gmail), and Proton Mail. We extend this comparison to a\nself-hosted email solution, evaluated with and without end-to-end encryption.\nWe show that the self-hosted solution, even with 14% of device energy and 15%\nof emissions overheads from PGP encryption, remains the most energy-efficient,\nsaving up to 33% of emissions per session compared to Gmail. Among commercial\nproviders, Proton Mail is the most efficient, saving up to 0.1 gCO2 e per\nsession compared to Outlook, whose emissions can be further reduced by 2%\nthrough ad-blocking."

While these\ncapabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also\nintroduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool\nmisuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the\nthreat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we\nfirst examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin\nincreasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,\nmodular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze\nthe corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying\nfailure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and\ndeceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.\nThese risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across\nperception, cognition, memory, and action modules.

This paper introduces a new embedding\nparadigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel\nsegments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during\ntransmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the\nCORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,\nCoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters\nwith stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By\nmodifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the\nselected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a\ngeneral plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can\nadaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the\nembedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation\nindicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across\nmultiple languages and fonts.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs\nto receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to\nattacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which\nis a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately\ndetect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments.

This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks.

We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through\niterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance\nminimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically\nevaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D\nobstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms\nstandard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative\nreward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the\npractical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for\nsecure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat\nscenarios."

        "abstract": "The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nhas exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in\nreinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing\nrobust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value\ndistribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To\naddress this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that\nenhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a\nswitching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism\ndynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially\ninduced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first\nderives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range\nof perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a\nmultiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in\nresponse to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving\nadversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by\noptimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,\nresults in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus\ninducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with\nmultiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected\ngradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,\nnon-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior\nperformance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of\nconflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques"

        "abstract": "The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things\n(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods\nthat can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,\nresource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning\nin decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient\nknowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience\nagainst poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by\ndeveloping P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to\ndeliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring\ndifferential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution\nemploys a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client\nsimilarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage\ndifferentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,\nmaintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of\nmalicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both\nlinear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and\nattack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher\naccuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and\nmaintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,\nwhere collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of\noverhead."

As a\nzero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and\nlearns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The\nproposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature\nextractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations\nthat are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is\nachieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion\ndiscriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the\nsecond module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme\nwhere the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable\nreference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that\nour method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and\nwatermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised\nand deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our\nframework in generalization and robustness."

        "abstract": "In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing\nmodels for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with\ndifferent random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises\nwhen these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for\nwhich ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.\nProviding recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under\nMM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,\nthe CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to\nresolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is\nparametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the\nspecification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further\ncustomisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different\nargumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of\nour method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)"

In practical settings,\nhowever, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often\nbefore previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes\nthe WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same\nsite as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements,\nresulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we\nconsider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses\nmultiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments,\nand similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,\nthereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named\nADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation\nto salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention\ncropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features\nfrom both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules\nto capture the global contextual patterns of the trace.

In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence.

Our\nmodel also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion\nto ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio\nenvironments.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called\nCollaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the\ndomain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the\nneural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific\nfeature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,\nwhile the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature\nrepresentation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source\nand target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly\nformulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on\nthe losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,\nwhich automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in\nCNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from\nhigher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the\ndiscriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which\nprogressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the\nclassifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled\ntarget samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on\ndifferent benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the\nobject recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action\nrecognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the\nstate-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of\nour proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation."

Through systematic\nevaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial\nknowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge\nconfigurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three\ncomplementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter\nmagnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success\nrates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.\nCritically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain\nattack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge\nconfigurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete\nknowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and\nempirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense\nmechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional\nattack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques.

While these attacks have been extensively studied,\ncurrent research predominantly focuses on analyzing each attack type\nindividually. In practice, however, adversaries may employ multiple attack\nstrategies simultaneously rather than relying on a single approach. This\nprompts a crucial yet underexplored question: When the adversary has multiple\nattacks at their disposal, are they able to mount or amplify the effect of one\nattack with another? In this paper, we take the first step in studying the\nstrategic interactions among different attacks, which we define as attack\ncompositions. Specifically, we focus on four well-studied attacks during the\nmodel's inference phase: adversarial examples, attribute inference, membership\ninference, and property inference. To facilitate the study of their\ninteractions, we propose a taxonomy based on three stages of the attack\npipeline: preparation, execution, and evaluation.

We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the attack compositions using three ML model architectures and\nthree benchmark image datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof these four attack compositions. We implement and release a modular reusable\ntoolkit, COAT.

In this paper, we present the first systematic\njailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and\nGPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack\nstrategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and\nsemantic domain.

In\ncontrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety\nalignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design\nand reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral\nanalysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial\nprompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal\nbehaviors.

        "abstract": "Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing\nmodels are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While\ngenerative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly\nfocus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of\nfalse positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial\ndiffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive\nvariability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false\npositive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,\nwe design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis\nspace using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric\ndiffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses\nexclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the\nDetector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs\nthe negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,\nguiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,\ndetector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.\nOur approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,\nestablishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving\nthe way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.\nExtensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our\nmethod over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving\nthe detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the\nbaselines.

Our\narchitecture fractures the traditional monolithic Trusted Application into\nper-chain modules housed in a multi-tenant TA store, finally breaking OP-TEE's\nsingle-binary ceiling. A cryptographically sealed firmware-over-the-air\npipeline welds each TA set to an Android system image, enabling hot-swap\nupdates while Verified Boot enforces rollback protection. Every package carries\na chained signature developer first, registry second so even a compromised\nsupply chain cannot smuggle malicious code past the Secure World's RSA-PSS\ngatekeeper. Inside the TEE, strict inter-TA isolation, cache partitioning, and\nGP-compliant crypto APIs ensure secrets never bleed across trust boundaries or\ntiming domains. The Rich Execution Environment can interact only via\nhardware-mediated Secure Monitor Calls, collapsing the surface exposed to\nmalware in Android space. End-users enjoy a single polished interface yet can\ninstall or retire Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or tomorrow's chain with one tap,\nshrinking both storage footprint and audit scope.

Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random\nselection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL\nperformance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to\nreduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve\nenergy efficiency.

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical\nsystems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While\nits integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,\nincluding those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these\nrisks, the terms \"AI Safety\" and \"AI Security\" are often used, sometimes\ninterchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to\ndemystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between\nAI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their\nrespective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how\nsecurity breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear\nanalogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate\nthese distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise\nresearch directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration,\nenhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of\ntrustworthy AI systems."

Existing safety alignment methods struggle\nto capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility\ntrade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a\nnovel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken\nsafety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,\nwe introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric\nthat effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct\nextensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious\ndata, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and\nreliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms\nstate-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety\nrisks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.\nAdditionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and\nefficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/AoShuang92/SPLoRA."

        "abstract": "Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in\nvision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that\nSDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to\nunrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in\nstatic scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated\nby this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch\nattack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement\nlearning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to\ndisrupt SDE assumptions.\n  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA\nsimulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses\noptimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly\nbetter black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions\nlike low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),\nwhereas optimization-based methods fail."
