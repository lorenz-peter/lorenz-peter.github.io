To address this challenge, this study focuses on\ncreating active defense mechanisms against AI VC systems.\n  We propose a novel active defense method, VocalCrypt, which embeds\npseudo-timbre (jamming information) based on SFS into audio segments that are\nimperceptible to the human ear, thereby forming systematic fragments to prevent\nvoice cloning. This approach protects the voice without compromising its\nquality. In comparison to existing methods, such as adversarial noise\nincorporation, VocalCrypt significantly enhances robustness and real-time\nperformance, achieving a 500\\% increase in generation speed while maintaining\ninterference effectiveness.\n  Unlike audio watermarking techniques, which focus on post-detection, our\nmethod offers preemptive defense, reducing implementation costs and enhancing\nfeasibility.

One unique challenge in this field is catastrophic unlearning, where\nerasing specific data from a well-trained model unintentionally removes\nessential knowledge, causing the model to deviate significantly from a\nretrained one. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that regularizes\nthe unlearning process by utilizing synthesized mixup samples, which simulate\nthe data susceptible to catastrophic effects. At the core of our approach is a\ngenerator-unlearner framework, MixUnlearn, where a generator adversarially\nproduces challenging mixup examples, and the unlearner effectively forgets\ntarget information based on these synthesized data. Specifically, we first\nintroduce a novel contrastive objective to train the generator in an\nadversarial direction: generating examples that prompt the unlearner to reveal\ninformation that should be forgotten, while losing essential knowledge. Then\nthe unlearner, guided by two other contrastive loss terms, processes the\nsynthesized and real data jointly to ensure accurate unlearning without losing\ncritical knowledge, overcoming catastrophic effects. Extensive evaluations\nacross benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches, offering a robust solution to machine unlearning.\nThis work not only deepens understanding of unlearning mechanisms but also lays\nthe foundation for effective machine unlearning with mixup augmentation."

Among these methods, assertion-based security\nverification has proven to be a promising approach for ensuring that security\nfeatures are effectively met. To this end, some approaches manually define\nsecurity assertions for processor designs; however, these manual methods\nrequire significant time, cost, and human expertise. Consequently, recent\napproaches focus on translating pre-defined security assertions from one design\nto another. Nonetheless, these methods are not primarily centered on processor\nsecurity, particularly RISC-V. Furthermore, many of these approaches have not\nbeen validated against real-world attacks, such as hardware Trojans. In this\nwork, we introduce a methodology for translating security assertions across\nprocessors with different architectures, using RISC-V as a case study.

Our methodology was applied to five critical security\nmodules with assertion translation achieving nearly 100% success across all\nmodules. These results validate the efficacy of our approach and highlight its\npotential for enhancing security verification in modern processor designs.

In this paper, we propose ChatIoT, a large language\nmodel (LLM)-based IoT security assistant designed to disseminate IoT security\nand threat intelligence. By leveraging the versatile property of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ChatIoT successfully integrates the\nadvanced language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM with\nfast-evolving IoT security information. Moreover, we develop an end-to-end data\nprocessing toolkit to handle heterogeneous datasets. This toolkit converts\ndatasets of various formats into retrievable documents and optimizes chunking\nstrategies for efficient retrieval. Additionally, we define a set of common use\ncase specifications to guide the LLM in generating answers aligned with users'\nspecific needs and expertise levels. Finally, we implement a prototype of\nChatIoT and conduct extensive experiments with different LLMs, such as LLaMA3,\nLLaMA3.1, and GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ChatIoT can\ngenerate more reliable, relevant, and technical in-depth answers for most use\ncases. When evaluating the answers with LLaMA3:70B, ChatIoT improves the above\nmetrics by over 10% on average, particularly in relevance and technicality,\ncompared to using LLMs alone."

This article\npresents two new complementary approaches for efficiently identifying\nvulnerable tree-based models: an ante-hoc analysis of hyperparameter choices\nand a post-hoc examination of trained model structure. While these new methods\ncannot certify whether a model is safe from MIA, they provide practitioners\nwith a means to significantly reduce the number of models that need to undergo\nexpensive MIA assessment through a hierarchical filtering approach.\n  More specifically, it is shown that the rank order of disclosure risk for\ndifferent hyperparameter combinations remains consistent across datasets,\nenabling the development of simple, human-interpretable rules for identifying\nrelatively high-risk models before training. While this ante-hoc analysis\ncannot determine absolute safety since this also depends on the specific\ndataset, it allows the elimination of unnecessarily risky configurations during\nhyperparameter tuning. Additionally, computationally inexpensive structural\nmetrics serve as indicators of MIA vulnerability, providing a second filtering\nstage to identify risky models after training but before conducting expensive\nattacks. Empirical results show that hyperparameter-based risk prediction rules\ncan achieve high accuracy in predicting the most at risk combinations of\nhyperparameters across different tree-based model types, while requiring no\nmodel training.

        "abstract": "A high volume of recent ML security literature focuses on attacks against\naligned large language models (LLMs). These attacks may extract private\ninformation or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world\ndeployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory\nsystems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components\nintroduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to\nattack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security\nof LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities\nthat are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks\ncategorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability,\nattack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then\nconduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial\nagents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their\nvulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no\nunderstanding of machine learning."

Sharpness-aware minimization\n(SAM) efficiently finds flat regions by updating the parameters according to\nthe gradient at an adversarial perturbation. The perturbation depends on the\nEuclidean metric, making SAM non-invariant under reparametrizations, which\nblurs sharpness and generalization. We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a\nreparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric\nin the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to\nprevious approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild\nassumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM. We theoretically\nargue that M-SAM varies between SAM and gradient descent (GD), which increases\nrobustness to hyperparameter selection and reduces attraction to suboptimal\nequilibria like saddle points. We demonstrate this behavior both theoretically\nand empirically on a multi-modal representation alignment task."

To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose CoDynTrust, an uncertainty-encoded asynchronous fusion perception\nframework that is robust to the information mismatches caused by temporal\nasynchrony. CoDynTrust generates dynamic feature trust modulus (DFTM) for each\nregion of interest by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as\nselectively suppressing or retaining single-vehicle features, thereby\nmitigating information mismatches. We then design a multi-scale fusion module\nto handle multi-scale feature maps processed by DFTM. Compared to existing\nworks that also consider asynchronous collaborative perception, CoDynTrust\ncombats various low-quality information in temporally asynchronous scenarios\nand allows uncertainty to be propagated to downstream tasks such as planning\nand control. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDynTrust significantly\nreduces performance degradation caused by temporal asynchrony across multiple\ndatasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with temporal\nasynchrony.

Local differential privacy\n(LDP) is regarded as an effective defense against various attacks, including\nsample reconstruction in FL, where gradients are clipped and perturbed.\nExisting attacks are ineffective in FL with LDP since clipped and perturbed\ngradients obliterate most sample information for reconstruction. Besides,\nexisting attacks embed additional sample information into gradients to improve\nthe attack effect and cause gradient expansion, leading to a more severe\ngradient clipping in FL with LDP. In this paper, we propose a sample\nreconstruction attack against LDP-based FL with any target models to\nreconstruct victims' sensitive samples to illustrate that FL with LDP is not\nflawless. Considering gradient expansion in reconstruction attacks and noise in\nLDP, the core of the proposed attack is gradient compression and reconstructed\nsample denoising. For gradient compression, an inference structure based on\nsample characteristics is presented to reduce redundant gradients against LDP.\nFor reconstructed sample denoising, we artificially introduce zero gradients to\nobserve noise distribution and scale confidence interval to filter the noise.\nTheoretical proof guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed attack.\nEvaluations show that the proposed attack is the only attack that reconstructs\nvictims' training samples in LDP-based FL and has little impact on the target\nmodel's accuracy.

In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based\non the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural\nnetworks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden\nrepresentations. We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts\nas toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that\nmanipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts. Through\nconcept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic\nconcepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts.

Most existing methods directly extract video-based rPPG features\nby designing neural networks for heart rate estimation. Although they can\nachieve acceptable results, the recovery of rPPG signal faces intractable\nchallenges when interference from real-world scenarios takes place on facial\nvideo. Specifically, facial videos are inevitably affected by non-physiological\nfactors (e.g., camera device noise, defocus, and motion blur), leading to the\ndistortion of extracted rPPG signals. Recent rPPG extraction methods are easily\naffected by interference and degradation, resulting in noisy rPPG signals. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method named CodePhys, which innovatively treats\nrPPG measurement as a code query task in a noise-free proxy space (i.e.,\ncodebook) constructed by ground-truth PPG signals. We consider noisy rPPG\nfeatures as queries and generate high-fidelity rPPG features by matching them\nwith noise-free PPG features from the codebook. Our approach also incorporates\na spatial-aware encoder network with a spatial attention mechanism to highlight\nphysiologically active areas and uses a distillation loss to reduce the\ninfluence of non-periodic visual interference.

For example, the\nstate-of-the-art byte-level model MalConv sees its accuracy drop from over 90%\nto below 2% under PGD (projected gradient descent) attacks. Existing\ngradient-based adversarial training techniques for malware detection or image\nprocessing were applied to malware attribution in this study, revealing that\nboth robustness and training efficiency require significant improvement.

In this paper, we analyze three\ntypes of mining power destruction attacks in the presence of petty-compliant\nmining pools: selfish mining, bribery, and mining power distraction attacks. We\nanalyze selfish mining while accounting for the distribution of mining power\namong pools, a factor often overlooked in the literature.

Lastly, we present the\nmining distraction attack, where the adversarial pool incentivizes\npetty-compliant pools to abandon Bitcoin's puzzle and mine for a simpler\npuzzle, thus wasting some part of their mining power.

In this work, we propose two novel\ntechniques to enhance generalization: dynamic color image normalization (DCIN)\nmodule and color-quality generalization (CQG) loss. The DCIN dynamically\nnormalizes the color of test images using two reference image selection\nstrategies. Specifically, the DCIN utilizes a global reference image selection\n(GRIS), which finds a universal reference image, and a local reference image\nselection (LRIS), which selects a semantically similar reference image per test\nsample. Additionally, CQG loss enforces invariance to color and quality\nvariations by ensuring consistent segmentation predictions across transformed\nimage pairs. Experimental results show that our proposals significantly improve\nsegmentation performance over the baseline on two target domain datasets,\ndespite being trained solely on a single source domain. Notably, our model\nachieved up to a 32.3-point increase in Dice score compared to the baseline,\nconsistently producing robust and usable results even under substantial domain\nshifts.

Digital Shadows (DS), leveraging\nmachine learning-driven data assimilation techniques such as nonlinear Bayesian\nfiltering and generative AI, provide a more detailed, uncertainty-aware\nmonitoring approach.

Still, the reward mechanism available in\ndecentralized systems, motivates the adversary to act rationally. While the\ndecoder, as the data collector (DC), has an acceptance and rejection mechanism,\nfollowed by an estimation module, the adversary aims to maximize its utility,\nas an increasing function of (1) the chance of acceptance (to increase the\nreward), and (2) estimation error. On the other hand, the decoder also adjusts\nits acceptance rule to maximize its own utility, as (1) an increasing function\nof the chance of acceptance (to keep the system functional), (2) decreasing\nfunction of the estimation error. Prior works within this framework rely on the\nassumption that the game is complete, that is, both the DC and the adversary\nare fully aware of each other's utility functions. However, in practice, the\ndecoder is often unaware of the utility of the adversary. To address this\nlimitation, we develop an algorithm enabling the DC to commit to a strategy\nthat achieves within the vicinity of the equilibrium, without knowledge of the\nadversary's utility function. Our approach builds on an observation that at the\nequilibrium, the relationship between the probability of acceptance and the\nmean squared error (MSE) follows a predetermined curve independent of the\nspecific utility functions of the players. By exploiting this invariant\nrelationship, the DC can iteratively refine its strategy based on observable\nparameters, converging to a near-optimal solution.

While research on black-box\nattacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on\npixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image\nclassification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily\ndepend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more\nsuitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,\nquery-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object\ndetection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box\nattack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement\nLearning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget\nprocesses. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging\nrewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR\neffectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while\nadhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed\nattack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the\nconfidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the\nImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed\nstate-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the\nMSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction\nto state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query.

One of the most effective techniques to\ndetect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD\nnode-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in\npractice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data\nsynthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable\nDiffusion.

Given the emerging threat of\nbackdoor attacks designed for SSL, this work aims to protect SSL against such\nrisks, marking it as one of the few known efforts in this area. Specifically,\nwe begin by identifying that the spurious correlations between the backdoor\ntriggers and the target class implanted by adversaries are the primary cause of\nmanipulated model predictions during the test phase. To disrupt these\ncorrelations, we utilize three key techniques: Gaussian Filter, complementary\nlearning and trigger mix-up, which collectively filter, obstruct and dilute the\ninfluence of backdoor attacks in both data pre-processing and feature learning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Backdoor Invalidator\n(BI), significantly reduces the average attack success rate from 84.7\\% to\n1.8\\% across different state-of-the-art backdoor attacks.

To tackle these challenges, researchers have separately\ndevised secure aggregation mechanisms to protect data privacy and robust\naggregation methods that withstand poisoning attacks. However, simultaneously\naddressing both concerns is challenging; secure aggregation facilitates\npoisoning attacks as most anomaly detection techniques require access to\nunencrypted local model updates, which are obscured by secure aggregation. Few\nrecent efforts to simultaneously tackle both challenges offen depend on\nimpractical assumption of non-colluding two-server setups that disrupt FL's\ntopology, or three-party computation which introduces scalability issues,\ncomplicating deployment and application. To overcome this dilemma, this paper\nintroduce a Dual Defense Federated learning (DDFed) framework. DDFed\nsimultaneously boosts privacy protection and mitigates poisoning attacks,\nwithout introducing new participant roles or disrupting the existing FL\ntopology. DDFed initially leverages cutting-edge fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE) to securely aggregate model updates, without the impractical requirement\nfor non-colluding two-server setups and ensures strong privacy protection.\nAdditionally, we proposes a unique two-phase anomaly detection mechanism for\nencrypted model updates, featuring secure similarity computation and\nfeedback-driven collaborative selection, with additional measures to prevent\npotential privacy breaches from Byzantine clients incorporated into the\ndetection process. We conducted extensive experiments on various model\npoisoning attacks and FL scenarios, including both cross-device and cross-silo\nFL.

In this\nwork, we observe that universal adversarial perturbations usually lead to\nabnormal entropy spectrum in hidden layers, which suggests that the prediction\nis dominated by a small number of ``feature'' in such cases (rather than\ndemocratically by many features). Inspired by this, we propose an efficient yet\neffective defense method for mitigating UAPs called \\emph{Democratic Training}\nby performing entropy-based model enhancement to suppress the effect of the\nuniversal adversarial perturbations in a given model. \\emph{Democratic\nTraining} is evaluated with 7 neural networks trained on 5 benchmark datasets\nand 5 types of state-of-the-art universal adversarial attack methods.

The celebrated Temporal Difference (TD)\nlearning algorithm addresses this problem, and recent work has investigated\nfinite-time convergence guarantees for this algorithm and variants thereof.\nHowever, these guarantees hinge on the reward observations being always\ngenerated from a well-behaved (e.g., sub-Gaussian) true reward distribution.\nMotivated by harsh, real-world environments where such an idealistic assumption\nmay no longer hold, we revisit the policy evaluation problem from the\nperspective of adversarial robustness. In particular, we consider a\nHuber-contaminated reward model where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt each\nreward sample with a small probability $\\epsilon$. Under this observation\nmodel, we first show that the adversary can cause the vanilla TD algorithm to\nconverge to any arbitrary value function. We then develop a novel algorithm\ncalled Robust-TD and prove that its finite-time guarantees match that of\nvanilla TD with linear function approximation up to a small $O(\\epsilon)$ term\nthat captures the effect of corruption. We complement this result with a\nminimax lower bound, revealing that such an additive corruption-induced term is\nunavoidable. To our knowledge, these results are the first of their kind in the\ncontext of adversarial robustness of stochastic approximation schemes driven by\nMarkov noise.

Previously, having gray-box access, where input embeddings\nor output logits/probabilities were visible to the user, might have been\nreasonable.

In this paper, we introduce the\n$\\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that\ndynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in\nsequences. The $\\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible\nsimilarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the\ninfluence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of\nthe dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This\ninfluence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all\nsequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the\ndirection of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a\nsequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model\nrelies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely,\nwhen the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is\nconsidered informative, and the $\\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new\ninput than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics.\nThe $\\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking\nand Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in\nsequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and\nimproving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and\nforecasting.

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of generative audio synthesis and editing\ntechnologies has raised significant concerns about copyright infringement, data\nprovenance, and the spread of misinformation through deepfake audio.\nWatermarking offers a proactive solution by embedding imperceptible,\nidentifiable, and traceable marks into audio content. While recent neural\nnetwork-based watermarking methods like WavMark and AudioSeal have improved\nrobustness and quality, they struggle to achieve both robust detection and\naccurate attribution simultaneously. This paper introduces Cross-Attention\nRobust Audio Watermark (XAttnMark), which bridges this gap by leveraging\npartial parameter sharing between the generator and the detector, a\ncross-attention mechanism for efficient message retrieval, and a temporal\nconditioning module for improved message distribution. Additionally, we propose\na psychoacoustic-aligned temporal-frequency masking loss that captures\nfine-grained auditory masking effects, enhancing watermark imperceptibility.\nOur approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both detection and\nattribution, demonstrating superior robustness against a wide range of audio\ntransformations, including challenging generative editing with strong editing\nstrength.

        "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful\nbehaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate\nattacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e.,\ntraining LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to\nbehave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays\na critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on\nadversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a\njailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\\Theta(M)$, it is enough\nto align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context\nlearning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust\ngeneralization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{M_{\\text{test}}}/M_{\\text{train}})$, where $M_{\\text{train}}$ and\n$M_{\\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples\nduring training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source\nLLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different\nadversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the\nattack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix\nduring jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is\npractical to defend \"long-length\" jailbreak attacks via efficient\n\"short-length\" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl."

However, malicious servers could deliberately\nmanipulate the models to reconstruct clients' data from shared gradients,\nposing significant privacy risks. Although such active gradient leakage attacks\n(AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from several limitations\nincluding incomplete attack coverage and poor stealthiness. In this paper, we\naddress these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a\nnew theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor\npoisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is\nto bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset\nof samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the\nabove limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient\nGlobal Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack\ncoverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a\ngradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient\nvulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data\nleakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage\nand surpasses SOTA with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality\n(PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR)."

Existing efforts usually rely on\nreactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened,\ne.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot\nmitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of\nattackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack\nstage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner,\nwe can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in\nthis work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers.\nSpecifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price\nmanipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it\nconducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and\ntransaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow\ndependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For\nscalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts\ninter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint\nattacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation\nresults illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines\nwith 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616\nattack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \\$9.25M financial losses, with\nonly 19 cases publicly reported.

To address this, we propose MultiQ&A, a systematic approach for\nevaluating the robustness and consistency of LLM-generated answers. We\ndemonstrate MultiQ&A's ability to crowdsource question perturbations and their\nrespective answers through independent LLM agents at scale. Our experiments\nculminated in the examination of 1.9 million question perturbations and 2.3\nmillion answers. Furthermore, MultiQ&A shows that ensembled LLMs, such as\ngpt-3.5-turbo, remain relatively robust and consistent under perturbations.\nMultiQ&A provides clarity in the response generation space, offering an\neffective method for inspecting disagreements and variability. Therefore, our\nsystem offers a potential framework for institutional LLM adoption with the\nability to measure confidence, consistency, and the quantification of\nhallucinations."

This paper presents a comprehensive study of adversarial\nattacks on both classic and recently proposed algorithms, including Behavior\nCloning (BC), LSTM-GMM, Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), Diffusion Policy (DP),\nand VQ-Behavior Transformer (VQ-BET). We study the vulnerability of these\nmethods to untargeted, targeted and universal adversarial perturbations. While\nexplicit policies, such as BC, LSTM-GMM and VQ-BET can be attacked in the same\nmanner as standard computer vision models, we find that attacks for implicit\nand denoising policy models are nuanced and require developing novel attack\nmethods. Our experiments on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks reveal\nthat most of the current methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations. We also show that these attacks are transferable across\nalgorithms, architectures, and tasks, raising concerning security\nvulnerabilities with potentially a white-box threat model. In addition, we test\nthe efficacy of a randomized smoothing, a widely used adversarial defense\ntechnique, and highlight its limitation in defending against attacks on complex\nand multi-modal action distribution common in complex control tasks.

However, documents tend to contain highly sensitive information,\nraising concerns about privacy risks associated with training such DocVQA\nmodels. One significant privacy vulnerability, exploited by the membership\ninference attack, is the possibility for an adversary to determine if a\nparticular record was part of the model's training data. In this paper, we\nintroduce two novel membership inference attacks tailored specifically to\nDocVQA models. These attacks are designed for two different adversarial\nscenarios: a white-box setting, where the attacker has full access to the model\narchitecture and parameters, and a black-box setting, where only the model's\noutputs are available. Notably, our attacks assume the adversary lacks access\nto auxiliary datasets, which is more realistic in practice but also more\nchallenging. Our unsupervised methods outperform existing state-of-the-art\nmembership inference attacks across a variety of DocVQA models and datasets,\ndemonstrating their effectiveness and highlighting the privacy risks in this\ndomain."

Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training\ntechnique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial\nrobustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert\nwithout compromising training or inference efficiency.

To\nreliably identify vulnerabilities in proprietary LLMs, this work investigates\nthe transferability of jailbreaking attacks by analysing their impact on the\nmodel's intent perception. By incorporating adversarial sequences, these\nattacks can redirect the source LLM's focus away from malicious-intent tokens\nin the original input, thereby obstructing the model's intent recognition and\neliciting harmful responses. Nevertheless, these adversarial sequences fail to\nmislead the target LLM's intent perception, allowing the target LLM to refocus\non malicious-intent tokens and abstain from responding. Our analysis further\nreveals the inherent distributional dependency within the generated adversarial\nsequences, whose effectiveness stems from overfitting the source LLM's\nparameters, resulting in limited transferability to target LLMs. To this end,\nwe propose the Perceived-importance Flatten (PiF) method, which uniformly\ndisperses the model's focus across neutral-intent tokens in the original input,\nthus obscuring malicious-intent tokens without relying on overfitted\nadversarial sequences.

By\nintroducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a\nfoundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare,\nensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical\nenvironments."

        "abstract": "Typical contextual bandit algorithms assume that the rewards at each round\nlie in some fixed range $[0, R]$, and their regret scales polynomially with\nthis reward range $R$. However, many practical scenarios naturally involve\nheavy-tailed rewards or rewards where the worst-case range can be substantially\nlarger than the variance. In this paper, we develop an algorithmic approach\nbuilding on Catoni's estimator from robust statistics, and apply it to\ncontextual bandits with general function approximation. When the variance of\nthe reward at each round is known, we use a variance-weighted regression\napproach and establish a regret bound that depends only on the cumulative\nreward variance and logarithmically on the reward range $R$ as well as the\nnumber of rounds $T$. For the unknown-variance case, we further propose a\ncareful peeling-based algorithm and remove the need for cumbersome variance\nestimation. With additional dependence on the fourth moment, our algorithm also\nenjoys a variance-based bound with logarithmic reward-range dependence.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the optimality of the leading-order term in our regret\nbound through a matching lower bound."

        "abstract": "Medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are becoming an instrumental\npart of healthcare systems, assisting medical personnel with decision making\nand results analysis. Models for radiology report generation are able to\ninterpret medical imagery, thus reducing the workload of radiologists. As\nmedical data is scarce and protected by privacy regulations, medical MLLMs\nrepresent valuable intellectual property. However, these assets are potentially\nvulnerable to model stealing, where attackers aim to replicate their\nfunctionality via black-box access. So far, model stealing for the medical\ndomain has focused on classification; however, existing attacks are not\neffective against MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Domain\nAlignment (ADA-STEAL), the first stealing attack against medical MLLMs.\nADA-STEAL relies on natural images, which are public and widely available, as\nopposed to their medical counterparts. We show that data augmentation with\nadversarial noise is sufficient to overcome the data distribution gap between\nnatural images and the domain-specific distribution of the victim MLLM.\nExperiments on the IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR radiology datasets demonstrate that\nAdversarial Domain Alignment enables attackers to steal the medical MLLM\nwithout any access to medical data."

Machine learning\nalgorithms for {\\Phi}-OTDR event classification require high volumes and\nquality of datasets; however, high-quality datasets are currently extremely\nscarce in the field, leading to a lack of robustness in models, which is\nmanifested by higher false alarm rates in real-world scenarios. One promising\napproach to address this issue is to augment existing data using generative\nmodels combined with a small amount of real-world data. We explored mapping\nboth {\\Phi}-OTDR features in a GAN-based generative pipeline and signal\nfeatures in a Transformer classifier to hyperbolic space to seek more effective\nmodel generalization. The results indicate that state-of-the-art models exhibit\nstronger generalization performance and lower false alarm rates in real-world\nscenarios when trained on augmented datasets.

Despite its\neconomic relevance, this trend largely overlooked the issue of credit card\nfraud detection. To address this gap, we propose a new threat model that\ndemonstrates the limitations of existing attacks and highlights the necessity\nto investigate new approaches. We then design a new adversarial attack for\ncredit card fraud detection, employing reinforcement learning to bypass\nclassifiers. This attack, called FRAUD-RLA, is designed to maximize the\nattacker's reward by optimizing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and\nworking with significantly less required knowledge than competitors. Our\nexperiments, conducted on three different heterogeneous datasets and against\ntwo fraud detection systems, indicate that FRAUD-RLA is effective, even\nconsidering the severe limitations imposed by our threat model."

        "abstract": "In the past decade, considerable research effort has been devoted to securing\nmachine learning (ML) models that operate in adversarial settings. Yet,\nprogress has been slow even for simple \"toy\" problems (e.g., robustness to\nsmall adversarial perturbations) and is often hindered by non-rigorous\nevaluations. Today, adversarial ML research has shifted towards studying\nlarger, general-purpose language models. In this position paper, we argue that\nthe situation is now even worse: in the era of LLMs, the field of adversarial\nML studies problems that are (1) less clearly defined, (2) harder to solve, and\n(3) even more challenging to evaluate. As a result, we caution that yet another\ndecade of work on adversarial ML may fail to produce meaningful progress."

        "abstract": "Well-trained large language models (LLMs) present significant risks,\nincluding potential malicious use and copyright infringement. Current studies\naim to trace the distribution of LLM-generated texts by implicitly embedding\nwatermarks. Among these, the single-bit watermarking method can only determine\nwhether a given text was generated by an LLM. In contrast, the multi-bit\nwatermarking method embeds richer information into the generated text, which\ncan identify which LLM generated and distributed a given text to which user.\nHowever, existing efforts embed the multi-bit watermark directly into the\ngenerated text without accounting for its watermarking capacity. This approach\ncan result in embedding failures when the text's watermarking capacity is\ninsufficient. In this paper, we derive the watermark embedding distribution\nbased on the logits of LLMs and propose a formal inequality to segment the text\noptimally for watermark embedding. Building on this foundation, we propose\nDERMARK, a dynamic, efficient, and robust multi-bit watermarking method.\nDERMARK divides the text into segments of varying lengths for each bit\nembedding, adaptively matching the text's capacity. It achieves this with\nnegligible overhead and robust performance against text editing by minimizing\nwatermark extraction loss. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, compared\nto the SOTA method, our method reduces the number of tokens required for\nembedding each bit by 20\\%, reduces watermark embedding time by 50\\%, and is\nrobust to text editing and watermark erasure attacks."

        "abstract": "One of the major goals of incident response is to help an organization or a\nsystem owner to quickly identify and halt the attacks to minimize the damages\n(and financial loss) to the system being attacked. Typical incident responses\nrely very much on the log information captured by the system during the attacks\nand if needed, may need to isolate the victim from the network to avoid further\ndestructive attacks. However, there are real cases that there are insufficient\nlog records/information for the incident response team to identify the attacks\nand their origins while the attacked system cannot be stopped due to service\nrequirements (zero downtime online systems) such as online gaming sites.\nTypical incident response procedures and industrial standards do not provide an\nadequate solution to address this scenario. In this paper, being motivated by a\nreal case, we propose a solution, called \"Attack-Driven Incident Response and\nDefense System (ADIRDS)\" to tackle this problem. ADIRDS is an online monitoring\nsystem to run with the real system. By modeling the real system as a graph,\ncritical nodes/assets of the system are closely monitored. Instead of relying\non the original logging system, evidence will be collected from the attack\ntechnique perspectives. To migrate the risks, realistic honeypots with very\nsimilar business context as the real system are deployed to trap the attackers.\nWe successfully apply this system to a real case. Based on our experiments, we\nverify that our new approach of designing the realistic honeypots is effective,\n38 unique attacker's IP addresses were captured. We also compare the\nperformance of our realistic honey with both low and high interactive honeypots\nproposed in the literature, the results found that our proposed honeypot can\nsuccessfully cheat the attackers to attack our honeypot, which verifies that\nour honeypot is more effective."

        "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method for measuring a subjects heart\nrate remotely using a camera. Factors such as subject movement, ambient light\nlevel, makeup etc. complicate such measurements by distorting the observed\npulse. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for\naccurately measuring heart rate in humans, however these methods were tested in\nideal conditions, where the subject does not make significant movements and all\nmeasurements are taken at the same level of illumination. In more realistic\nconditions these methods suffer from decreased accuracy. The study proposes a\nmore robust method that is less susceptible to distortions and has minimal\nhardware requirements. The proposed method uses a combination of mathematical\ntransforms to calculate the subjects heart rate. It performs best when used\nwith a camera that has been modified by removing its infrared filter, although\nusing an unmodified camera is also possible. The method was tested on 26 videos\ntaken from 19 volunteers of varying gender and age. The obtained results were\ncompared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be\nat 1.95 beats per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from\nprevious works. The remote photoplethysmography method proposed in the present\narticle is more resistant to distortions than methods from previous\npublications and thus allows one to remotely and accurately measure the\nsubjects heart rate without imposing any significant limitations on the\nsubjects behavior."
