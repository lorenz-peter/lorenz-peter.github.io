        "abstract": "Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect\nprompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in\ntool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions.\nExisting defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require\nessential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated\nattacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution\nand TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the\nobservation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes\nless dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we\ndesign MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a\nmasked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack\nif the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We\nalso include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and\nfalse negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo\ndemonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and\nutility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt\naugmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance.\nWe also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs."

Machine\nlearning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are\ntypically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which\nraises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining\npopularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data.\nHowever, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions.\nWhile adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain\nlargely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain.\nMoreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly\nunknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in\nenergy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models,\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in\nan FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method\n(FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data.\nThe results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks,\nattributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10%\neven with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks\nthan centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL."

However, existing works rely on priors about clean graphs or attacking\nstrategies, which are often heuristic and inconsistent. To achieve robust graph\nlearning over different types of evasion attacks and diverse datasets, we\ninvestigate this problem from a prior-free structure purification perspective.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Structure Purification\nframework named DiffSP, which creatively incorporates the graph diffusion model\nto learn intrinsic distributions of clean graphs and purify the perturbed\nstructures by removing adversaries under the direction of the captured\npredictive patterns without relying on priors. DiffSP is divided into the\nforward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process, during which\nstructure purification is achieved. To avoid valuable information loss during\nthe forward process, we propose an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion mechanism\nto selectively inject noise anisotropically. To promote semantic alignment\nbetween the clean graph and the purified graph generated during the reverse\nprocess, we reduce the generation uncertainty by the proposed graph transfer\nentropy guided denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior robustness of DiffSP against evasion attacks."

In outlier\ndetection, this calibration relies on a reference set of labeled inlier data to\ncontrol the type-I error rate. However, obtaining a perfectly labeled inlier\nreference set is often unrealistic, and a more practical scenario involves\naccess to a contaminated reference set containing a small fraction of outliers.\nThis paper analyzes the impact of such contamination on the validity of\nconformal methods. We prove that under realistic, non-adversarial settings,\ncalibration on contaminated data yields conservative type-I error control,\nshedding light on the inherent robustness of conformal methods. This\nconservativeness, however, typically results in a loss of power. To alleviate\nthis limitation, we propose a novel, active data-cleaning framework that\nleverages a limited labeling budget and an outlier detection model to\nselectively annotate data points in the contaminated reference set that are\nsuspected as outliers. By removing only the annotated outliers in this\n``suspicious'' subset, we can effectively enhance power while mitigating the\nrisk of inflating the type-I error rate, as supported by our theoretical\nanalysis.

The $\\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible\nsimilarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the\ninfluence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of\nthe dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This\ninfluence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all\nsequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the\ndirection of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a\nsequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model\nrelies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely,\nwhen the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is\nconsidered informative, and the $\\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new\ninput than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics.\nThe $\\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking\nand Alternator loss minimization.

        "abstract": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to\ndifferentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text\ndetectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed\nglobal threshold (e.g., {\\theta} = 0.5) to classify machine-generated text.\nHowever, we find that one universal threshold can fail to account for\nsubgroup-specific distributional variations. For example, when using a fixed\nthreshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written\ntext than longer, and more positive classifications on neurotic writing styles\nthan open among long text. These discrepancies can lead to misclassification\nthat disproportionately affects certain groups. We address this critical\nlimitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold\noptimization in AI-generated content classifiers. Our approach partitions data\ninto subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and\nlearns decision thresholds for each group, which enables careful balancing of\nperformance and fairness metrics within each subgroup. In experiments with four\nAI text classifiers on three datasets, FairOPT enhances overall F1 score and\ndecreases balanced error rate (BER) discrepancy across subgroups. Our framework\npaves the way for more robust and fair classification criteria in AI-generated\noutput detection."

        "abstract": "In October 2023, 23andMe, a prominent provider of personal genetic testing,\nancestry, and health information services, suffered a significant data breach\norchestrated by a cybercriminal known as ``Golem.'' Initially, approximately\n14,000 user accounts were compromised by a credential smear attack, exploiting\nreused usernames and passwords from previous data leaks. However, due to the\ninterconnected nature of 23andMe's DNA Relatives and Family Tree features, the\nbreach expanded exponentially, exposing sensitive personal and genetic data of\napproximately 5.5 million users and 1.4 million additional profiles. The attack\nhighlights the increasing threat of credential stuffing, exacerbated by poor\npassword hygiene and the absence of robust security measures such as\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA) and rate limiting. In response, 23andMe\nmandated password resets, implemented email-based two-step verification, and\nadvised users to update passwords across other services. This paper critically\nanalyzes the attack methodology, its impact on users and the company, and\nexplores potential mitigation strategies, including enhanced authentication\nprotocols, proactive breach detection, and improved cybersecurity practices.\nThe findings underscore the necessity of stronger user authentication measures\nand corporate responsibility in safeguarding sensitive genetic and personal\ndata."

        "abstract": "Robust training methods typically defend against specific attack types, such\nas Lp attacks with fixed budgets, and rarely account for the fact that\ndefenders may encounter new attacks over time. A natural solution is to adapt\nthe defended model to new adversaries as they arise via fine-tuning, a method\nwhich we call continual robust training (CRT). However, when implemented\nnaively, fine-tuning on new attacks degrades robustness on previous attacks.\nThis raises the question: how can we improve the initial training and\nfine-tuning of the model to simultaneously achieve robustness against previous\nand new attacks? We present theoretical results which show that the gap in a\nmodel's robustness against different attacks is bounded by how far each attack\nperturbs a sample in the model's logit space, suggesting that regularizing with\nrespect to this logit space distance can help maintain robustness against\nprevious attacks. Extensive experiments on 3 datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNette) and over 100 attack combinations demonstrate that the proposed\nregularization improves robust accuracy with little overhead in training time.\nOur findings and open-source code lay the groundwork for the deployment of\nmodels robust to evolving attacks."

        "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful\nbehaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate\nattacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e.,\ntraining LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to\nbehave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays\na critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on\nadversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a\njailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\\Theta(M)$, it is enough\nto align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context\nlearning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust\ngeneralization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{M_{\\text{test}}}/M_{\\text{train}})$, where $M_{\\text{train}}$ and\n$M_{\\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples\nduring training and testing.

Results confirm a positive correlation between the\nattack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix\nduring jailbreaking to the length during AT.

However, malicious servers could deliberately\nmanipulate the models to reconstruct clients' data from shared gradients,\nposing significant privacy risks. Although such active gradient leakage attacks\n(AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from several limitations\nincluding incomplete attack coverage and poor stealthiness. In this paper, we\naddress these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a\nnew theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor\npoisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is\nto bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset\nof samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the\nabove limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient\nGlobal Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack\ncoverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a\ngradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient\nvulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data\nleakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage\nand surpasses SOTA with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality\n(PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR)."

To address these\nlimitations, this work proposes a defense mechanism that leverages semantic\nsimilarity to detect backdoor attacks without modifying the model structure or\nimposing data format constraints. By analyzing deviations in semantic feature\nspace and establishing a threshold-based detection framework, the proposed\napproach effectively identifies poisoned samples. The experimental results\ndemonstrate high detection accuracy and recall across varying poisoning ratios,\nunderlining the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution."

        "abstract": "Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an\nextensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on\nreactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened,\ne.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot\nmitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of\nattackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack\nstage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner,\nwe can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in\nthis work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers.\nSpecifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price\nmanipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it\nconducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and\ntransaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow\ndependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For\nscalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts\ninter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint\nattacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation\nresults illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines\nwith 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616\nattack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \\$9.25M financial losses, with\nonly 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector\nin Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after\nthe corresponding deployment on average. These attacks have already led to\n$641K financial losses, and seven of them are still waiting for their ripe\ntime."

To\nreliably identify vulnerabilities in proprietary LLMs, this work investigates\nthe transferability of jailbreaking attacks by analysing their impact on the\nmodel's intent perception. By incorporating adversarial sequences, these\nattacks can redirect the source LLM's focus away from malicious-intent tokens\nin the original input, thereby obstructing the model's intent recognition and\neliciting harmful responses.

This capability makes MIAs important\nin assessing privacy leakage within modern generative AI systems. However, this\npaper reveals an oversight in existing MIAs against \\emph{distilled generative\nmodels}: attackers can no longer detect a teacher model's training instances\nindividually when targeting the distilled student model, as the student learns\nfrom the teacher-generated data rather than its original member data,\npreventing direct instance-level memorization.

This leads us to\nposit that MIAs \\emph{on distilled generative models should shift from\ninstance-level to distribution-level statistics}. We thereby introduce a\n\\emph{set-based} MIA framework that measures \\emph{relative} distributional\ndiscrepancies between student-generated data\\emph{sets} and potential\nmember/non-member data\\emph{sets}, Empirically, distributional statistics\nreliably distinguish a teacher's member data from non-member data through the\ndistilled model.

Our method iteratively refines the reward hypothesis\nspace through \"cuts\" based on batches of human preferences. Within each batch,\nhuman preferences, queried based on disagreement, are grouped using a voting\nfunction to determine the appropriate cut, ensuring a bounded human query\ncomplexity. To handle unknown erroneous preferences, we introduce a\nconservative cutting method within each batch, preventing erroneous human\npreferences from making overly aggressive cuts to the hypothesis space.

Typical incident responses\nrely very much on the log information captured by the system during the attacks\nand if needed, may need to isolate the victim from the network to avoid further\ndestructive attacks. However, there are real cases that there are insufficient\nlog records/information for the incident response team to identify the attacks\nand their origins while the attacked system cannot be stopped due to service\nrequirements (zero downtime online systems) such as online gaming sites.\nTypical incident response procedures and industrial standards do not provide an\nadequate solution to address this scenario. In this paper, being motivated by a\nreal case, we propose a solution, called \"Attack-Driven Incident Response and\nDefense System (ADIRDS)\" to tackle this problem. ADIRDS is an online monitoring\nsystem to run with the real system. By modeling the real system as a graph,\ncritical nodes/assets of the system are closely monitored. Instead of relying\non the original logging system, evidence will be collected from the attack\ntechnique perspectives. To migrate the risks, realistic honeypots with very\nsimilar business context as the real system are deployed to trap the attackers.\nWe successfully apply this system to a real case. Based on our experiments, we\nverify that our new approach of designing the realistic honeypots is effective,\n38 unique attacker's IP addresses were captured. We also compare the\nperformance of our realistic honey with both low and high interactive honeypots\nproposed in the literature, the results found that our proposed honeypot can\nsuccessfully cheat the attackers to attack our honeypot, which verifies that\nour honeypot is more effective."

Factors such as subject movement, ambient light\nlevel, makeup etc. complicate such measurements by distorting the observed\npulse. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for\naccurately measuring heart rate in humans, however these methods were tested in\nideal conditions, where the subject does not make significant movements and all\nmeasurements are taken at the same level of illumination. In more realistic\nconditions these methods suffer from decreased accuracy. The study proposes a\nmore robust method that is less susceptible to distortions and has minimal\nhardware requirements. The proposed method uses a combination of mathematical\ntransforms to calculate the subjects heart rate. It performs best when used\nwith a camera that has been modified by removing its infrared filter, although\nusing an unmodified camera is also possible. The method was tested on 26 videos\ntaken from 19 volunteers of varying gender and age.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel approach named Regor, which is a progressive\ncorrespondence regenerator that generates higher-quality matches whist\nsufficiently robust for numerous outliers. In each iteration, we first apply\nprior-guided local grouping and generalized mutual matching to generate the\nlocal region correspondences. A powerful center-aware three-point consistency\nis then presented to achieve local correspondence correction, instead of\nremoval. Further, we employ global correspondence refinement to obtain accurate\ncorrespondences from a global perspective.

Extensive\nexperiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nRegor significantly outperforms existing outlier removal techniques.

The proposed planner generates collision-free\nwaypoints in milliseconds, enabling drones to perform agile maneuvers in\ncomplex environments without building separate perception, mapping, and\nplanning modules. Learning-based methods, such as behavior cloning (BC) and\nreinforcement learning (RL), demonstrate promising performance in visual\nnavigation but still face inherent limitations. BC is susceptible to\ncompounding errors due to limited expert imitation, while RL struggles with\nreward function design and sample inefficiency. To address these limitations,\nthis paper proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework for\nhigh-speed visual navigation. By leveraging IRL, it is possible to reduce the\nnumber of interactions with simulation environments and improve capability to\ndeal with high-dimensional spaces while preserving the robustness of RL\npolicies. A motion primitive-based path planning algorithm collects an expert\ndataset with privileged map data from diverse environments, ensuring\ncomprehensive scenario coverage. By leveraging both the acquired expert and\nlearner dataset gathered from the agent's interactions with the simulation\nenvironments, a robust reward function and policy are learned across diverse\nstates. While the proposed method is trained in a simulation environment only,\nit can be directly applied to real-world scenarios without additional training\nor tuning. The performance of the proposed method is validated in both\nsimulation and real-world environments, including forests and various\nstructures. The trained policy achieves an average speed of 7 m/s and a maximum\nspeed of 8.8 m/s in real flight experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first work to successfully apply an IRL framework for high-speed visual\nnavigation of drones."

To safeguard\ngradients privacy against gradient inversion attacks, clients are dynamically\ngrouped, allowing one client's gradient to be divided to obfuscate the\ngradients of other clients within the group. This method incorporates checks\nand balances to reduce the collusion for inferring specific client data.

Each client's gradients are\nencrypted and stored, with decryption collectively managed by all clients. The\ndetected poisoning gradients are invalidated from the global model through a\nunlearning method. To our best knowledge, we present the first practical secure\naggregation scheme, which does not require trusted participants, avoids the\nperformance degradation associated with traditional noise-injection, and aviods\ncomplex cryptographic operations during gradient aggregation.

While existing detection approaches demonstrate high accuracy,\nthey often require substantial computational resources, making them impractical\nfor IoT deployment. This paper introduces a novel lightweight approach to DoS\nattack detection based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). By leveraging\nspline-based transformations instead of traditional weight matrices, our\nsolution achieves state-of-the-art detection performance while maintaining\nminimal resource requirements. Experimental evaluation on the CICIDS2017\ndataset demonstrates 99.0% detection accuracy with only 0.19 MB memory\nfootprint and 2.00 ms inference time per sample. Compared to existing\nsolutions, KAN reduces memory requirements by up to 98% while maintaining\ncompetitive detection rates. The model's linear computational complexity\nensures efficient scaling with input size, making it particularly suitable for\nlarge-scale IoT deployments. We provide comprehensive performance comparisons\nwith recent approaches and demonstrate effectiveness across various DoS attack\npatterns. Our solution addresses the critical challenge of implementing\nsophisticated attack detection on resource-constrained devices, offering a\npractical approach to enhancing IoT security without compromising computational\nefficiency."

To this end, we utilize a modular learned reconstruction\nin which a key component is a pre-processor prior to image recovery. We\ntheoretically demonstrate the pre-processor's necessity for standard image\nrecovery techniques (Wiener filtering and iterative algorithms), and through\nextensive experiments show its effectiveness for multiple lensless imaging\napproaches and across datasets of different mask types (amplitude and phase).\nWe also perform the first generalization benchmark across mask types to\nevaluate how well reconstructions trained with one system generalize to others.\nOur modular reconstruction enables us to use pre-trained components and\ntransfer learning on new systems to cut down weeks of tedious measurements and\ntraining. As part of our work, we open-source four datasets, and software for\nmeasuring datasets and for training our modular reconstruction."

In\nprevious studies, several works have attempted to synthesize\nvisually-collocated clothing based on a given clothing item using generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) with promising results. These works, however, can\nonly accomplish the synthesis of one collocated clothing item each time.\nNevertheless, users may require different clothing items to meet their multiple\nchoices due to their personal tastes and different dressing scenarios. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a novel batch clothing generation\nframework, named BC-GAN, which is able to synthesize multiple\nvisually-collocated clothing images simultaneously. In particular, to further\nimprove the fashion compatibility of synthetic results, BC-GAN proposes a new\nfashion compatibility discriminator in a contrastive learning perspective by\nfully exploiting the collocation relationship among all clothing items. Our\nmodel was examined in a large-scale dataset with compatible outfits constructed\nby ourselves. Extensive experiment results confirmed the effectiveness of our\nproposed BC-GAN in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in terms of\ndiversity, visual authenticity, and fashion compatibility."

In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are among the first\nattempts towards robust and private LLM inference by tightly integrating two\ndisconnected fields: private inference and prompt ensembling. The former\nprotects users' privacy by encrypting inference data transmitted and processed\nby LLMs, while the latter enhances adversarial robustness by yielding an\naggregated output from multiple prompted LLM responses. Although widely\nrecognized as effective individually, private inference for prompt ensembling\ntogether entails new challenges that render the naive combination of existing\ntechniques inefficient. To overcome the hurdles, we propose SecPE, which\ndesigns efficient fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) counterparts for the core\nalgorithmic building blocks of prompt ensembling.

The results show that SecPE maintains high clean accuracy and offers\nbetter robustness at the expense of merely $2.5\\%$ efficiency overhead compared\nto baseline private inference methods, indicating a satisfactory\n``accuracy-robustness-efficiency'' tradeoff.

To remedy this, we propose an\nadversarial semantic augmentation (ASA) technique to enlarge the training data\nat the semantic level instead of the image level.

In this paper, we introduce the first voice-based jailbreak attack\nagainst multimodal LLMs, termed as Flanking Attack, which can process different\ntypes of input simultaneously towards the multimodal LLMs. Our work is\nmotivated by recent advancements in monolingual voice-driven large language\nmodels, which have introduced new attack surfaces beyond traditional text-based\nvulnerabilities for LLMs. To investigate these risks, we examine the frontier\nmultimodal LLMs, which can be accessed via different types of inputs such as\naudio input, focusing on how adversarial prompts can bypass its defense\nmechanisms. We propose a novel strategy, in which the disallowed prompt is\nflanked by benign, narrative-driven prompts.

To better evaluate the attack performance,\nwe present a semi-automated self-assessment framework for policy violation\ndetection.

To unlock this threat, this paper introduces the first\ndata overvaluation attack, enabling strategic clients to have their data\nsignificantly overvalued. Furthermore, we propose a truthful data valuation\nmetric, named Truth-Shapley. Truth-Shapley is the unique metric that guarantees\nsome promising axioms for data valuation while ensuring that clients' optimal\nstrategy is to perform truthful data valuation.

Through theoretical analysis of QAT in linear models, we\ndemonstrate that the gradient of the loss function can be decomposed into two\nterms: the original full-precision loss and a term that causes quantization\noscillations. Based on these insights, we propose a novel regularization method\nthat induces oscillations to improve quantization robustness. Contrary to\ntraditional methods that focuses on minimizing the effects of oscillations, our\napproach leverages the beneficial aspects of weight oscillations to preserve\nmodel performance under quantization. Our empirical results on ResNet-18 and\nTiny ViT demonstrate that this counter-intuitive strategy matches QAT accuracy\nat >= 3-bit weight quantization, while maintaining close to full precision\naccuracy at bits greater than the target bit. Our work therefore provides a new\nperspective on model preparation for quantization, particularly for finding\nweights that are robust to changes in the bit of the quantizer -- an area where\ncurrent methods struggle to match the accuracy of QAT at specific bits."

Action recognition models often suffer\nfrom background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and\nforeground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental\nto real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living\nmonitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background\nbias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both biases. We\npropose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that mitigates foreground\nand background biases without requiring specialized knowledge of the bias\nattributes. Our framework applies an adversarial cross-entropy loss to the\nsampled static clip (where all the frames are the same) and aims to make its\nclass probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy maximization loss.\nAdditionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for regularization against\nthe debiasing process. We evaluate our method on established background and\nforeground bias protocols, setting a new state-of-the-art and strongly\nimproving combined debiasing performance by over 12% on HMDB51. Furthermore, we\nidentify an issue of background leakage in the existing UCF101 protocol for\nbias evaluation which provides a shortcut to predict actions and does not\nprovide an accurate measure of the debiasing capability of a model.

For example, Panopticon,\nthe inspiration for PRAC, is rendered insecure if implemented per JEDEC's PRAC\nspecification. On the other hand, the recent UPRAC proposal is impractical\nsince it needs oracular knowledge of the `top-N' activated DRAM rows that\nrequire mitigation.\n  This paper provides the first secure, scalable, and practical RowHammer\nsolution using the PRAC framework. The crux of our proposal is the design of a\npriority-based service queue (PSQ) for mitigations that prioritizes pending\nmitigations based on activation counts to avoid the security risks of prior\nsolutions. This provides principled security using the reactive ABO protocol.\nFurthermore, we co-design our PSQ, with opportunistic mitigation on Refresh\nManagement (RFM) operations and proactive mitigation during refresh (REF), to\nlimit the performance impact of ABO-based mitigations. QPRAC provides secure\nand practical RowHammer mitigation that scales to Rowhammer thresholds as low\nas 71 while incurring a 0.8% slowdown for benign workloads, which further\nreduces to 0% with proactive mitigations."

        "abstract": "RowHammer vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to modern DRAM-based\nsystems, where rapid activation of DRAM rows can induce bit-flips in\nneighboring rows. To mitigate this, state-of-the-art host-side RowHammer\nmitigations typically rely on shared counters or tracking structures. While\nthese optimizations benefit benign applications, they are vulnerable to\nPerformance Attacks (Perf-Attacks), where adversaries exploit shared structures\nto reduce DRAM bandwidth for co-running benign applications by increasing DRAM\naccesses for RowHammer counters or triggering repetitive refreshes required for\nthe early reset of structures, significantly degrading performance.\n  In this paper, we propose secure hashing mechanisms to thwart adversarial\nattempts to capture the mapping of shared structures. We propose DAPPER, a\nnovel low-cost tracker resilient to Perf-Attacks even at ultra-low RowHammer\nthresholds. We first present a secure hashing template in the form of DAPPER-S.\nWe then develop DAPPER-H, an enhanced version of DAPPER-S, incorporating\ndouble-hashing, novel reset strategies, and mitigative refresh techniques. Our\nsecurity analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of DAPPER-H against both\nRowHammer and Perf-Attacks. Experiments with 57 workloads from SPEC2006,\nSPEC2017, TPC, Hadoop, MediaBench, and YCSB show that, even at an ultra-low\nRowHammer threshold of 500, DAPPER-H incurs only a 0.9% slowdown in the\npresence of Perf-Attacks while using only 96KB of SRAM per 32GB of DRAM memory."

The learning objective is to achieve\ndesired positions from random initial conditions while adhering to both\ntransient and steady-state performance specifications. This objective is\nchallenging for conventional one-stage end-to-end reinforcement learning, due\nto the strong coupling between position and orientation dynamics, the\ncomplexity in designing and tuning the reward function, and poor sample\nefficiency, which necessitates substantial computational resources and leads to\nextended convergence times.

The curriculum begins with learning to achieve\nstable hovering from a fixed initial condition, followed by progressively\nintroducing randomization in initial positions, orientations and velocities. A\nnovel additive reward function is proposed, to incorporate transient and\nsteady-state performance specifications. The results demonstrate that the\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based curriculum learning approach, coupled\nwith the proposed reward structure, achieves superior performance compared to a\nsingle-stage PPO-trained policy with the same reward function, while\nsignificantly reducing computational resource requirements and convergence\ntime.

The GitHub Advisory Database\ncontains advisories for security risks in GitHub-hosted OSS projects. As of\n09/25/2023, there are 197,609 unreviewed GitHub security advisories. Of those\nunreviewed, at least 63,852 are publicly documented vulnerabilities,\npotentially leaving many OSS projects vulnerable. Recently, bug bounty\nplatforms have emerged to focus solely on providing bounties to help secure\nOSS. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 3,798 reviewed GitHub\nsecurity advisories and 4,033 disclosed OSS bug bounty reports, a perspective\nthat is currently understudied, because they contain comprehensive information\nabout security incidents, e.g., the nature of vulnerabilities, their impact,\nand how they were resolved. We are the first to determine the explicit process\ndescribing how OSS vulnerabilities propagate from security advisories and bug\nbounty reports, which are the main intermediaries between vulnerability\nreporters, OSS maintainers, and dependent projects, to vulnerable OSS projects\nand entries in global vulnerability databases and possibly back. This process\nuncovers how missing or delayed CVE assignments for OSS vulnerabilities result\nin projects, both in and out of OSS, not being notified of necessary security\nupdates promptly and corresponding bottlenecks.

Previous work revealed that\npre-trained models can remember the content of their training data and\nregurgitate them through data extraction attacks. Due to the large size of\ncurrent models, only a few entities have the resources for pre-training such\nmodels. However, fine-tuning requires fewer resources and is increasingly used\nby both small and large entities for its effectiveness on specialized data.\nSuch small curated data for fine-tuning might contain sensitive information or\nproprietary assets. In this study, we attack both pre-trained and fine-tuned\ncode language models to investigate the extent of data extractability. We first\ndevelop a custom benchmark to assess the vulnerability of both pre-training and\nfine-tuning samples to extraction attacks. Our findings reveal that 54.9% of\nextractable pre-training data could be retrieved from StarCoder2-15B, whereas\nthis number decreased to 23.5% after fine-tuning. This indicates that\nfine-tuning reduces the extractability of pre-training data. However, compared\nto larger models, fine-tuning smaller models increases their vulnerability to\ndata extraction attacks on fine-tuning data. Given the potential sensitivity of\nfine-tuning data, this can lead to more severe consequences. Lastly, we also\nmanually analyzed 2000 extractable samples before and after fine-tuning.

        "abstract": "Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an\nemerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine\nlearning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each\nmicrostructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained\nfoundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic\nmicrostructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a\nmicrostructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained\nstate-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOV2, SAM) in two case studies on\nmachine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on\nsimulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys\nbased on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the\npotential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure\nrepresentation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property\nrelationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or\nfine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models."

        "abstract": "The indexing-retrieval-generation paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) has been highly successful in solving knowledge-intensive tasks by\nintegrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, the\nincorporation of external and unverified knowledge increases the vulnerability\nof LLMs because attackers can perform attack tasks by manipulating knowledge.\nIn this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the\nRAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context\nconflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service. Next, we construct RAG security\nevaluation dataset (i.e., SafeRAG dataset) primarily manually for each task. We\nthen utilize the SafeRAG dataset to simulate various attack scenarios that RAG\nmay encounter. Experiments conducted on 14 representative RAG components\ndemonstrate that RAG exhibits significant vulnerability to all attack tasks and\neven the most apparent attack task can easily bypass existing retrievers,\nfilters, or advanced LLMs, resulting in the degradation of RAG service quality.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/SafeRAG."

        "abstract": "Judging the safety of an action, whether taken by a human or a system, must\ntake into account the context in which the action takes place. For example,\ndeleting an email from a user's mailbox may or may not be appropriate depending\non the email's content, the user's goals, or even available space. Systems\ntoday that make these judgements -- providing security against harmful or\ninappropriate actions -- rely on manually-crafted policies or user confirmation\nfor each relevant context. With the upcoming deployment of systems like\ngeneralist agents, we argue that we must rethink security designs to adapt to\nthe scale of contexts and capabilities of these systems. As a first step, this\npaper explores contextual security in the domain of agents and proposes\ncontextual security for agents (Conseca), a framework to generate just-in-time,\ncontextual, and human-verifiable security policies."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16971v1",
        "abstract": "In recent years, there have been significant improvements in various forms of\nimage outlier detection. However, outlier detection performance under\nadversarial settings lags far behind that in standard settings. This is due to\nthe lack of effective exposure to adversarial scenarios during training,\nespecially on unseen outliers, leading to detection models failing to learn\nrobust features. To bridge this gap, we introduce RODEO, a data-centric\napproach that generates effective outliers for robust outlier detection. More\nspecifically, we show that incorporating outlier exposure (OE) and adversarial\ntraining can be an effective strategy for this purpose, as long as the exposed\ntraining outliers meet certain characteristics, including diversity, and both\nconceptual differentiability and analogy to the inlier samples. We leverage a\ntext-to-image model to achieve this goal. We demonstrate both quantitatively\nand qualitatively that our adaptive OE method effectively generates ``diverse''\nand ``near-distribution'' outliers, leveraging information from both text and\nimage domains. Moreover, our experimental results show that utilizing our\nsynthesized outliers significantly enhances the performance of the outlier\ndetector, particularly in adversarial settings."

        "abstract": "Detecting cyberattacks using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has seen promising\nresults recently. Most of the state-of-the-art models that leverage these\ntechniques require labeled examples, hard to obtain in many real-world\nscenarios. To address this issue, unsupervised learning and Self-Supervised\nLearning (SSL) have emerged as interesting approaches to reduce the dependency\non labeled data. Nonetheless, these methods tend to yield more anomalous\ndetection algorithms rather than effective attack detection systems. This paper\nintroduces Few Edges Are Enough (FEAE), a GNN-based architecture trained with\nSSL and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) to better distinguish between false positive\nanomalies and actual attacks. To maximize the potential of few-shot examples,\nour model employs a hybrid self-supervised objective that combines the\nadvantages of contrastive-based and reconstruction-based SSL. By leveraging\nonly a minimal number of labeled attack events, represented as attack edges,\nFEAE achieves competitive performance on two well-known network datasets\ncompared to both supervised and unsupervised methods. Remarkably, our\nexperimental results unveil that employing only 1 malicious event for each\nattack type in the dataset is sufficient to achieve substantial improvements.\nFEAE not only outperforms self-supervised GNN baselines but also surpasses some\nsupervised approaches on one of the datasets."

We systematically reviewed papers published\nbetween 2005--2023 to identify key aspects of Stack Overflow that can affect\nstudy results, such as the language or context of code snippets. Our analysis\nreveals that certain aspects are non-stationary over time, which could lead to\ndifferent conclusions if experiments are repeated at different times. We\nreplicated six studies using a more recent dataset to demonstrate this risk.\nOur findings show that four papers produced significantly different results\nthan the original findings, preventing the same conclusions from being drawn\nwith a newer dataset version. Consequently, we recommend treating Stack\nOverflow as a time series data source to provide context for interpreting\ncross-sectional research conclusions."

        "abstract": "We study a generalization of the Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework\nwith time-varying adversarial constraints. In this problem, after selecting a\nfeasible action from the convex decision set $X,$ a convex constraint function\nis revealed alongside the cost function in each round. Our goal is to design a\ncomputationally efficient learning policy that achieves a small regret with\nrespect to the cost functions and a small cumulative constraint violation (CCV)\nwith respect to the constraint functions over a horizon of length $T$. It is\nwell-known that the projection step constitutes the major computational\nbottleneck of the standard OCO algorithms. However, for many structured\ndecision sets, linear functions can be efficiently optimized over the decision\nset. We propose a *projection-free* online policy which makes a single call to\na Linear Program (LP) solver per round. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art\nprojection-free online algorithms with adversarial constraints, achieving\nimproved bounds of $\\tilde{O}(T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ for both regret and CCV. The\nproposed algorithm is conceptually simple - it first constructs a surrogate\ncost function as a non-negative linear combination of the cost and constraint\nfunctions. Then, it passes the surrogate costs to a new, adaptive version of\nthe online conditional gradient subroutine, which we propose in this paper."

        "abstract": "The study of adversarial defense still struggles to combat with advanced\nadversarial attacks. In contrast to most prior studies that rely on the\ndiffusion model for test-time defense to remarkably increase the inference\ntime, we propose Masked AutoEncoder Purifier (MAEP), which integrates Masked\nAutoEncoder (MAE) into an adversarial purifier framework for test-time\npurification. While MAEP achieves promising adversarial robustness, it\nparticularly features model defense transferability and attack generalization\nwithout relying on using additional data that is different from the training\ndataset. To our knowledge, MAEP is the first study of adversarial purifier\nbased on MAE. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can\nnot only maintain clear accuracy with only a slight drop but also exhibit a\nclose gap between the clean and robust accuracy. Notably, MAEP trained on\nCIFAR10 achieves state-of-the-art performance even when tested directly on\nImageNet, outperforming existing diffusion-based models trained specifically on\nImageNet."
