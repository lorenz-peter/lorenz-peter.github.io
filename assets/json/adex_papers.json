        "abstract": "Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic\nHealth Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively\nleveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as\nreal-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing\napproaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection\nstrategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where\ndata availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework\ndesigned for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health\narchitecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing\nmodalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging\nspecialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach\ndynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data\nmodalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability\nscenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical\nclinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of\nstay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal\nfusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality\navailability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal\ninformation, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in\nhandling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly\nsuitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous\ndata availability."

        "abstract": "Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and\nfitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in\nreal-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source\nheterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and\nuser heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across\nindividuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of\nreal-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,\nParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that\nour model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates\ntheir strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm\nthe practical value of our model."

        "abstract": "Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection\nand user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face\nsignificant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for\nlarge-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to\ncertain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of\ncomprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an\noptimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the\nintermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically\ninserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail\nwatermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization\nterms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the\nchallenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising\nsteps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods,\nreducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that\nOptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust\nresilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations,\nediting, and regeneration attacks."

        "abstract": "Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily\nrely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).\nHowever, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to\nmisclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can\nimprove the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive\naugmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce\nunnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection\nmodel. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but\nrather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper\nproposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the\ntarget regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing\nbackground interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more\ndirectly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby\nimproving the attack success rate.

Using a user study with\ndomain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit\npeer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial\nprompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial\nLLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show\nthat adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that\nadversely affect a \"honest-but-lazy\" reviewer.

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that\nsingle-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and\nschedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,\nreal-world contexts.

In practice, factors such as\nurban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather\nfrequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where\nonly partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this\nsource of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current\nresearch. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy\nCorrespondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to\nbridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this\nend, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a\nnovel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated\ndata uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential\nco-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high\ncorrespondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature\nlearning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from\ntraditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty\nand loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing\nrobust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves\nsuperior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods\nin various noise ratios."

        "abstract": "Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to the performance and integrity of\npre-trained language models. Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that\ngradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers,\nwhereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic\nattacks."

To assess attack\nfeasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in\nstandard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are\nonly possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously:\nmodels must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ\npre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in\ntraining-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance under realistic training conditions. We extend these efforts by\npresenting the first attack on a production-grade object-detection model. Here,\nto enable any visibly identifiable leakage, we revert to the lenient inference\nmode setting and make multiple architectural modifications to increase model\nvulnerability, with the extent of required changes highlighting the strong\ninherent robustness of such architectures. We conclude this work by offering\nthe first comprehensive mapping of settings, clarifying which combinations of\narchitectural choices and operational modes meaningfully impact privacy.

In particular, LLMs are\nincreasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating\npredictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or\nsupervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised\nlearning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially\nexplains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also\nconsider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained\nspecifically for data fitting.

However, their\nreal-world application in SOCs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we\npresent a longitudinal study of 3,090 analyst queries from 45 SOC analysts over\n10 months. Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for\nsensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes\ndeterminations, preserving analyst decision authority.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability.

However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and\ntext modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and\nfairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal\nprompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal\nrepresentations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that\nseparates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned\nrepresentations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are\nconstructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to\nproduce fused features.

We evaluate PolyProtect in\nterms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and\nunlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted\nusing EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a\nreal-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.\nMoreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its\nevaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ntime that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and\nfor fingerprint biometrics.

        "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for\ntraining autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world\ndriving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents."

        "abstract": "The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an\nagent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying\nsafety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong\nduality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that\ntraditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To\novercome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called\nRectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the\nprimal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical\nconvergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence\nto an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching\nthe best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a\nspecific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe\nperformance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate\nthe worst-case safety constraints."

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial\ncompatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on\nregistration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at\nleast quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while\nmulti-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima\nbetween decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping\nregistration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation\nis decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and\na 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via\nBnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.\nFirstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere\nparameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated\nthrough interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.\nSecondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D\nRMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved\ndeterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment\ntree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets\ndemonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time\ncomplexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the\nnumber of points, even in the worst case."

A common\npractice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard\nnetwork inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies\nrisk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding\ninformation from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this\npaper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),\na novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind.

Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure\nreliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window\nlengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the\neffect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score\nbased on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service\nprovider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to\nfilter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In\nthis paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations.

Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible\nwatermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense\nagainst these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,\nthey rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which\nproves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define\nand demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first\ntime. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of\nwatermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or\nremoved, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To\naddress this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named\nAdversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network\narchitecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and\nintroduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse\nand stable watermark representations.

        "abstract": "We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the\nadversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an\naction from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost\nfunction $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and\nconsumption functions are assumed to be $\\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad\nclass that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex\noptimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex\nCover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online\nalgorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while\napproximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an\nefficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\\sqrt{T})$\n$\\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at\nmost $O(B_T \\log T)+ \\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information\nand bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach\nyields an efficient solution for the $\\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with\nKnapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower\nbounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize\nthe class of $\\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results\napply to a broad family of problems."

To\naddress these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding\nLVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine\ncognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global\nContextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained\nLocal Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement\nModule to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator\nto ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an\nadaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for\nrobust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,\nincluding GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring\nExpression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4.

Our analysis spans four diverse\ndatasets (two from the image domain and two in tabular format), exploring how\ndifferent unlearning approaches influence the exposure of models to membership\ninference. The findings highlight that while Machine Unlearning is not\ninherently a countermeasure against MIA, the unlearning algorithm and data\ncharacteristics can significantly affect a model's vulnerability. This work\nprovides essential insights into the interplay between Machine Unlearning and\nMIAs, offering guidance for the design of privacy-preserving machine learning\nsystems."

This transition introduces systemic\nsecurity risks, including control-flow hijacking and cascading failures, that\ntraditional cybersecurity paradigms are ill-equipped to address. This paper\nintroduces the Aegis Protocol, a layered security framework designed to provide\nstrong security guarantees for open agentic ecosystems. The protocol integrates\nthree technological pillars: (1) non-spoofable agent identity via W3C\nDecentralized Identifiers (DIDs); (2) communication integrity via\nNIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (PQC); and (3) verifiable,\nprivacy-preserving policy compliance using the Halo2 zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)\nsystem. We formalize an adversary model extending Dolev-Yao for agentic threats\nand validate the protocol against the STRIDE framework. Our quantitative\nevaluation used a discrete-event simulation, calibrated against cryptographic\nbenchmarks, to model 1,000 agents. The simulation showed a 0 percent success\nrate across 20,000 attack trials. For policy verification, analysis of the\nsimulation logs reported a median proof-generation latency of 2.79 seconds,\nestablishing a performance baseline for this class of security. While the\nevaluation is simulation-based and early-stage, it offers a reproducible\nbaseline for future empirical studies and positions Aegis as a foundation for\nsafe, scalable autonomous AI."

However,\nintegrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely\nunexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the\nunlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this\npaper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated\nunlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the\nglobal model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we\npropose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor\nand camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated\ntraining process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage\nsamples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state.

This\nseems to be the reason why the best previous key-recovery attack is on 6-round\n\\textsc{Ascon}, while for Keccak keyed modes (Keccak-MAC and Keyak) the\nattacked round is no less than 7-round.\n  In this paper, we generalize the conditional cube attack proposed by Huang\n\\emph{et~al.}, and find new cubes depending on some key bit conditions for\n5/6-round reduced \\textsc{Ascon}, and translate the previous theoretic 6-round\nattack with $2^{66}$ time complexity to a practical one with $2^{40}$ time\ncomplexity. Moreover, we propose the first 7-round key-recovery attack on\n\\textsc{Ascon}. By introducing \\emph{the cube-like key-subset technique}, we\ndivide the full key space into many subsets according to different key\nconditions. For each key subset, we launch the cube tester to determine if the\nkey falls into it. Finally, we recover the full key space by testing all the\nkey subsets. The total time complexity is about $2^{103.9}$. In addition, for a\nweak-key subset, whose size is $2^{117}$, the attack is more efficient and\ncosts only $2^{77}$ time complexity. Those attacks do not threaten the full\nround (12 rounds) \\textsc{Ascon}."

However, this approach is overly conservative: as\nprediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to\npotential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted\nlower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during\ninferencing. We prove that $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ achieves a log-scale\ncompetitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,\nhighlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.\nMoreover, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the\nprediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output\nlength are typically more challenging to predict accurately."

Existing attack methods, however, often rely\non idealized assumptions and fail to remain effective under real-world\nconstraints, such as limited attacker control, non-IID data distributions, and\nthe presence of diverse defense mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose\nDOPA (Divergent Optimization Path Attack), a novel framework that simulates\nheterogeneous local training dynamics and seeks consensus across divergent\noptimization trajectories to craft universally effective and stealthy backdoor\ntriggers. By leveraging consistency signals across simulated paths to guide\noptimization, DOPA overcomes the challenge of heterogeneity-induced instability\nand achieves practical attack viability under stringent federated constraints.\nWe validate DOPA on a comprehensive suite of 12 defense strategies, two model\narchitectures (ResNet18/VGG16), two datasets (CIFAR-10/TinyImageNet), and both\nmild and extreme non-IID settings. Despite operating under a single-client,\nblack-box, and sparsely participating threat model, DOPA consistently achieves\nhigh attack success, minimal accuracy degradation, low runtime, and long-term\npersistence.

However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our\nScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different\nsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios\nimproves the model robustness.

To address these challenges, we propose\nSelf-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models\n(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by\nclassifiers.

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address\nsuch vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected\nmalicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.\nHowever, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,\napplying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging\nbecause their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit.

FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process.

Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features.

        "abstract": "By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with\nexternal tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a\ncornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel\nattack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused\non attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more\nfundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are\nembedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has\nbeen primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,\nlarge-scale evaluation.\n  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent\nrobustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is\nconstructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To\nachieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a\ncomprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering\n10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents\nsetting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,\nachieving an attack success rate of 72.8\\%. We find that more capable models\nare often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior\ninstruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals\nthat agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate\n(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment\nis ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for\nunauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for\nunderstanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for\nthe development of verifiably safer AI agents.

        "abstract": "Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of\n\\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,\nenabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed\nnoises, have recently attracted significant attention\n\\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.\nHowever, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few\nexceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits\n(MABs) \\citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.\n  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed\nbandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the\nloss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus\nfunction, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm\nfor heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity\nassumption and achieves an $\\widetilde{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$\nworst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\nT)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework\nto the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed\nlinear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the\nbest-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose\na general data-dependent learning rate, termed \\textit{heavy-tailed noise aware\nstability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW\nregret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions\nare satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear\nloss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear\nbandits."

        "abstract": "Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI\nagents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,\nneglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.\nRecent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:\n(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the\ndesired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and\nedges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how\nhumans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the\nValley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background\ndistractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes\nthe model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For\nthe issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired\napproach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight\ngradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution\nfollows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.\nConsequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to\nconcentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by\nV2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks\nScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's\ncontribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding\ntasks."

Its core operation, scalar multiplication,\ndenoted as $k \\cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar,\nrelies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$\nis selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in\nresource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches\nmay yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to\nside-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we\nintroduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly\nmaximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a\npopulation-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary\nrepresentations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically\nuniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection\nas an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based\ncryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly\nhigher than conventionally generated scalars.

However, a falsely\ndetected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive\nenvironments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.\nTherefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false\npositive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly\nfocus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge\nof the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,\nwe propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the\nhistorical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in\nchallenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used\nto estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory\nis then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the\ntrajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to\ndetermine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and\nreal-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify\nits robustness and efficiency.
