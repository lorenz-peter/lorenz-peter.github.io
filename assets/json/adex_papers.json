        "abstract": "Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form\nof dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with\ngenerative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively\nproduce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this\nquestion by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common\nEnglish dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200\nunique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our\nautomatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art\nmultimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation\nwhen a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods\nsuch as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance\nby small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance\ndegradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a\ngeneral encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our\nmethod teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE\nperformance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our\nmethod is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on\npar with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance."

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising\nsecurity paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by\nidentifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML\nmodels is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial\ntraffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely\non overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or\nspecialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g.,\ntraining data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic\nblack-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack\n(i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target\ninsights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop\nNetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack\nflows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a\ntailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized\ntokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic\npatterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework,\nallowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences\nbased on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy\nattacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios,\nachieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods\nthat are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion\nattacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic\ngeneration, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios."

Detecting spurious code injections using automated\ntools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of\nboth the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an\nunsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying\ncohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion\n(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is\nintroduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707\nfunctions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection\nreduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive\nnames compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of\nreal supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme\ntest-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC\ncan effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100\nof 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000.

The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17\nproperties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into\nliveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,\nthese properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of\ncoordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security\nvulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously\ngrounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and\ndeployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems."

We comprehensively analyzed\nmultiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath\napparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit\nextreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and\nrobot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under\nmodest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language\nvariations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore\nlanguage instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that\nhigh benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for\nevaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation."

Shadow model technique is\ncommonly employed in such attacks, such as membership inference.

Such inefficiency mainly stems from the\nindependent training and use of these shadow models. To address this issue, we\npresent a novel shadow pool training framework SHAPOOL, which constructs\nmultiple shared models and trains them jointly within a single process. In\nparticular, we leverage the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism as the shadow pool to\ninterconnect individual models, enabling them to share some sub-networks and\nthereby improving efficiency. To ensure the shared models closely resemble\nindependent models and serve as effective substitutes, we introduce three novel\nmodules: path-choice routing, pathway regularization, and pathway alignment.\nThese modules guarantee random data allocation for pathway learning, promote\ndiversity among shared models, and maintain consistency with target models. We\nevaluate SHAPOOL in the context of various membership inference attacks and\nshow that it significantly reduces the computational cost of shadow model\nconstruction while maintaining comparable attack performance."

        "abstract": "Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving\nearly due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,\ndependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which\ntreatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an\nassumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average\ntreatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring\nbias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as\nnon-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial\nidentification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework\nhelps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite\ninformative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates\nthe bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable\ntheoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle\nefficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through\nnumerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,\nour framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated\ntreatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable\nuse of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology."

Unlike prior\nworks that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we\npropose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,\neach assigned to a dedicated base learner.

In this work, we introduce the first paradigm of\nrevocable backdoor attacks, where the backdoor can be proactively and\nthoroughly removed after the attack objective is achieved. We formulate the\ntrigger optimization in revocable backdoor attacks as a bilevel optimization\nproblem: by simulating both backdoor injection and unlearning processes, the\ntrigger generator is optimized to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR)\nwhile ensuring that the backdoor can be easily erased through unlearning. To\nmitigate the optimization conflict between injection and removal objectives, we\nemploy a deterministic partition of poisoning and unlearning samples to reduce\nsampling-induced variance, and further apply the Projected Conflicting Gradient\n(PCGrad) technique to resolve the remaining gradient conflicts.

In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these\npatches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual\nlatent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent\nrepresentations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.\nThrough the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's\ninterpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate\nincorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given\nrobotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for\nthe visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent\nrepresentations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.\nExtensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation\nbenchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate\nof cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates\nthis degradation.

In this paper,\nwe present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry\npersonas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,\nor belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or\ndistractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered\ninquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find\nthat such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes\nsuch as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion.

        "abstract": "Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and\nconvenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,\nrecent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic\naccuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training\nenvironment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning\nmethods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they\noften struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the\ntraining setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of\ndisease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and\nenvironment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative\nto task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning\nframework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),\ngrounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a\nlimited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and\nleverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess\nTMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset\ncomprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21\ndiseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just\n10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models\ntrained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned\nwith these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves\naverage macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a\nremarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional\nmetric learning."

We\npresent KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,\nsemantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or\nadversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an\nadversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity\nmetrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are\nspecifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL\ndivergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the\nL0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a\nformal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a\nsimple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to\nensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a\nlightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data\nmodalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet\nconfirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA\nconsistently and effectively detects adversarial examples.

However, these methods struggle in\nreal-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to\nparaphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic\ndiversity or hybrid human-AI authorship.

The framework features two key contributions: the\ndevelopment of the 2D Sin-Cos Pi Hyperchaotic Map (2D-SCPHM), which offers a\nbroader chaotic range and superior pseudorandom sequence generation, and the\nintroduction of Kun-SCAN, a novel permutation strategy that significantly\nreduces pixel correlations, enhancing resistance to statistical attacks. Kun-IE\nis flexible and supports encryption for images of any size. Experimental\nresults and security analyses demonstrate its robustness against various\ncryptanalytic attacks, making it a strong solution for secure image\ncommunication.

        "abstract": "LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate increasing integration into\nnext-generation applications, but their safety in backdoor attacks remains\nlargely underexplored. However, existing research has focused exclusively on\nsingle-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced\nby agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first\nDistributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into\nmultiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools.\nThese primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only\nwhen agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full\nbackdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess\nthis threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a\nsandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nattack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading\nperformance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces\nthat exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond\nsingle-agent protection.

Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such\nanomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to\nenhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring\nextensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives.\nAs agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from\nsoftware system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis\nframework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies.\nIn particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract\nstable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors.

By validating execution traces against\nboth hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively\ndetect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we\nintroduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios:\nhealthcare and corporate procurement.

This\ncognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and\nshort-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment\n(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a\nstructured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we\nintroduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000\npreference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a\nmulti-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning\nchains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to\ninstill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process\nReward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized\nreasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's\nalignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this\nrationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides\npolicy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online\nreinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural\nlanguage feedback.

Black-box methods presume access only to the\nmodel's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While\nthey have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that\nrarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training\nhyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same\ndistribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in\nthe evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these\nassumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box\nattacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the\nImplicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any\nreference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a\nsetting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly\nrealistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging\nFace). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.\nThis is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct\nthe trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings\nwhere only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available."

Although full access to source codes,\nmodel parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we\nargue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their\nill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic\nformalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible\nthreat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and\ncapabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,\nwho inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of\npractical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on\nopen-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying\ntargeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing\npayloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness\nagainst quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded\npayloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the\nperformance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the\nleast degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and\nChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER\noutperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while\nachieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%.

This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the\nrobustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing\napproach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving\nmutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs\nacross multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness\nflaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they\ninitially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving\nmutations.

The diffusion\nprocess progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for\ntraining a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility\nconstraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the\ncamera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current\nmethods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,\nthereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the\nreverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and\nrefines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current\ntimestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the\ntimestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network\nto achieve more accurate pose predictions.

        "abstract": "Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a\nprincipled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems.\nHowever, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution\nshifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control\nsynthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control\nobjectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably\nleads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC\nframework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with\ndownstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets\nto be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and\nyielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a\nbilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under\nDRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging\ncontrol-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve\nthis program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian\nalgorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the\nlearned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a\nnovel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the\nbilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the\nlearnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to\nstationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically\nconsistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate.\nExperiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the\nproposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness\ncompared against state-of-the-art methods."

Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF\nmodels has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that\nreliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains\na challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,\nnon-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks\ninfeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class\nimbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that\nwill produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining\nphysical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another\nsignificant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a\nnovel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate\nadversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model\nto approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of\ngradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function\nwith kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem.

Our first message is conceptual: conventional\ngeneralization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture\nout-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be\nquantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth\n$f^\\star$, which is $\\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of\nrobust estimation.

We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the\nVLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes\npredefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.\nSpecifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO\nthat incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.\nIn addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim\nVLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and\nsuccess to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to\nsuccessfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the\nphysical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on\nclean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that\nthe action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack\nperformance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and\nBadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at\nhttps://goba-attack.github.io/."

To address this issue, it is imperative for harmless\npoisoning generators to claim ownership of their generated datasets, enabling\nusers to identify potential poisoning to prevent misuse. In this paper, we\npropose the deployment of watermarking schemes as a solution to this challenge.\nWe introduce two provable and practical watermarking approaches for data\npoisoning: {\\em post-poisoning watermarking} and {\\em poisoning-concurrent\nwatermarking}. Our analyses demonstrate that when the watermarking length is\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_w)$ for post-poisoning watermarking, and falls within\nthe range of $\\Theta(1/\\epsilon_w^2)$ to $O(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_p)$ for\npoisoning-concurrent watermarking, the watermarked poisoning dataset provably\nensures both watermarking detectability and poisoning utility, certifying the\npracticality of watermarking under data poisoning attacks.

This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive\nbecause the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by\nchance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's\nlow-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the\ntwo directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.\nGradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of\nforgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward\npropagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation.

Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current\ndefenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate\nmalicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that\nprevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach\ninspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not\ncontain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we\npropose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any\ninstructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious\ninstructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this\napproach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the\ncontext of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with\nreadily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on\nunrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic\norigin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across\na wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB\nand SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on\nAgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious\nsettings."

However, current source-free domain adaptation\nframeworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without\nthe consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process\nfrom source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model\nadaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely\nlearning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which\nconsists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former\ncurriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and\ngradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the\nsample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which\nensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We\nevaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public\ncross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation.

CoTri\nrelies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and\nsubsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step\nmanipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task.

Through extensive empirical studies on 14\ndefense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal\nseveral alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses\nto sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect\nprivacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of\nmisuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and\nexacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to\nuncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the\nexistence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing\nsensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency\nanalysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key\nrole in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense\ndeployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward\nholistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies."

        "abstract": "Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving\ncollaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to\nByzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.\nExisting Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor\nscreening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete\nhigh-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,\ncreating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent\ndeployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that\ndecouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based\nneighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to\n$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity\ncomparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,\nreducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +\nd|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the\naccepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both\nstrongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression\npreserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where\napproximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$ factor in the effective\nthreshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,\nnetwork topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains\nidentical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation\ntime by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering\neffectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality\nand network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based\ncompression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale."

Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive\nfeature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We\nposit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding\ninstead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel\nframework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end\noptimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D\nfoundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation\nthrough a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including\ndepth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive\nevaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions\nwith superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic\npriors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models\nfrom limited input views.

We observe\nthat existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries\ndisguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of\ndistinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these\ninsights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense\nthat detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)\nmid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to\nprevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to\npredict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized\nprompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.\nExtensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,\nQwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense\nsignificantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense\nagainst harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining\ncompetitive performance on benign tasks.

Despite their significance in\npsychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition\nremains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.\nOptical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to\nits effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only\nbetween the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion\ninformation in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first\nintroduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated\nCombined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both\nmicro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in\nrecognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a\nnovel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase\nanalysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the\nnetwork to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for\nclassification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM\ndatasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our\nproposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,\nunderscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing\nmicro-expression recognition."

We propose a new framework\nthat provides distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees on both miscoverage\nand regret for any family of robust predict-then-optimize policies. Our method\nconstructs valid estimators that trace out the miscoverage-regret Pareto\nfrontier, enabling decision-makers to reliably evaluate and calibrate\nrobustness levels according to their cost-risk preferences. The framework is\nsimple to implement, broadly applicable across classical optimization\nformulations, and achieves sharper finite-sample performance than existing\napproaches.

Furthermore, most of HSI\nclassification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial\ndata to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To\naddress this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion\nNetwork (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to\ncomplement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN\nleverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class\nlabel that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These\ndescriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text\nencoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in\nturn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification\nperformance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our\nmodel on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,\nHyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance\nboost.
