        "abstract": "Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

        "abstract": "LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.\n  Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning.\n  PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs."

        "abstract": "Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines."

Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems."

        "abstract": "Jailbreak prompts are a practical and evolving threat to large language models (LLMs), particularly in agentic systems that execute tools over untrusted content. Many attacks exploit long-context hiding, semantic camouflage, and lightweight obfuscations that can evade single-pass guardrails. We present RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework built on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), in which a root model orchestrates a bounded analysis program that transforms the input, queries worker models over covered segments, and aggregates evidence into an auditable decision. RLM-JB treats detection as a procedure rather than a one-shot classification: it normalizes and de-obfuscates suspicious inputs, chunks text to reduce context dilution and guarantee coverage, performs parallel chunk screening, and composes cross-chunk signals to recover split-payload attacks. On AutoDAN-style adversarial inputs, RLM-JB achieves high detection effectiveness across three LLM backends (ASR/Recall 92.5-98.0%) while maintaining very high precision (98.99-100%) and low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%), highlighting a practical sensitivity-specificity trade-off as the screening backend changes."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16494v1",
        "abstract": "Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack."

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, and has been widely adopted in privacy-sensitive scenarios. However, FL faces two critical security threats: curious servers that may launch inference attacks to reconstruct clients' private data, and compromised clients that can launch poisoning attacks to disrupt model aggregation. Existing solutions mitigate these attacks by combining mainstream privacy-preserving techniques with defensive aggregation strategies. However, they either incur high computation and communication overhead or perform poorly under non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data settings. To tackle these challenges, we propose SRFed, an efficient Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL framework for Non-IID scenarios. First, we design a decentralized efficient functional encryption (DEFE) scheme to support efficient model encryption and non-interactive decryption. DEFE also eliminates third-party reliance and defends against server-side inference attacks. Second, we develop a privacy-preserving defensive model aggregation mechanism based on DEFE. This mechanism filters poisonous models under Non-IID data by layer-wise projection and clustering-based analysis. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that SRFed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in privacy protection, Byzantine robustness, and efficiency."

        "abstract": "Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures."

        "abstract": "The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved strong results on high-dimensional control tasks, but applying RL to reachability problems raises a fundamental mismatch: reachability seeks to maximize the set of states from which a system remains safe indefinitely, while RL optimizes expected returns over a user-specified distribution. This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations."

In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

Furthermore, as comparison we analyze a natural analogue of SGLD utilizing gradient clipping.

The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel \"Castle-Moat-Rampart\" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons.

In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability.

Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%.

        "abstract": "Language models now routinely produce text that is difficult to distinguish from human writing, raising the need for robust tools to verify content provenance. Watermarking has emerged as a promising countermeasure, with existing work largely focused on model quality preservation and robust detection. However, current schemes provide limited protection against false attribution. We strengthen the notion of soundness by introducing two novel guarantees: unforgeability and recoverability. Unforgeability prevents adversaries from crafting false positives, texts that are far from any output from the watermarked model but are nonetheless flagged as watermarked. Recoverability provides an additional layer of protection: whenever a watermark is detected, the detector identifies the source text from which the flagged content was derived. Together, these properties strengthen content ownership by linking content exclusively to its generating model, enabling secure attribution and fine-grained traceability. We construct the first undetectable watermarking scheme that is robust, unforgeable, and recoverable with respect to substitutions (i.e., perturbations in Hamming metric). The key technical ingredient is a new cryptographic primitive called robust (or recoverable) digital signatures, which allow verification of messages that are close to signed ones, while preventing forgery of messages that are far from all previously signed messages. We show that any standard digital signature scheme can be boosted to a robust one using property-preserving hash functions (Boyle, LaVigne, and Vaikuntanathan, ITCS 2019)."

Building on this framework, we identify emerging security and privacy challenges introduced by Agentic AI and summarize targeted strategies to address these vulnerabilities. A case study further demonstrates Agentic AI's efficacy in defending against intelligent eavesdropping attacks.

However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods."

Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks."

This decentralized approach has emerged as a promising solution for collaborative learning on sensitive user data, effectively addressing the longstanding privacy concerns inherent in centralized systems. However, the decentralized nature of FL exposes new security vulnerabilities, especially backdoor attacks that threaten model integrity. To investigate this critical concern, this paper presents the Layer Smoothing Attack (LSA), a novel backdoor attack that exploits layer-specific vulnerabilities in neural networks. First, a Layer Substitution Analysis methodology systematically identifies backdoor-critical (BC) layers that contribute most significantly to backdoor success. Subsequently, LSA strategically manipulates these BC layers to inject persistent backdoors while remaining undetected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that LSA achieves a remarkably backdoor success rate of up to 97% while maintaining high model accuracy on the primary task, consistently bypassing modern FL defenses. These findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in current FL security frameworks, demonstrating that future defenses must incorporate layer-aware detection and mitigation strategies."

While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs."

In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine."

We consider a non-stationary environment that subsumes both stochastic and adversarial models and where, at each round, both losses and constraints are drawn from distributions that may change arbitrarily over time. In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints (\\emph{e.g.}, via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum). We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and \\emph{positive} constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints. Specifically, under \\emph{full feedback} we propose an algorithm attaining $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}+C)$ regret and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation, where $C$ quantifies the amount of non-stationarity in the constraints.

In response, the international cybersecurity community has prioritized the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), a new cryptographic standard designed to resist quantum attacks while operating on classical computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already standardized several PQC algorithms and plans to deprecate classical asymmetric schemes, such as RSA and ECDSA, by 2035. Despite this urgency, PQC adoption remains slow, often due to limited developer expertise. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are intended to bridge this gap, yet prior research on classical security APIs demonstrates that poor usability of cryptographic APIs can lead developers to introduce vulnerabilities during implementation of the applications, a risk amplified by the novelty and complexity of PQC. To date, the usability of PQC APIs has not been systematically studied. This research presents an empirical evaluation of the usability of the PQC APIs, observing how developers interact with APIs and documentation during software development tasks. The study identifies cognitive factors that influence the developer's performance when working with PQC primitives with minimal onboarding. The findings highlight opportunities across the PQC ecosystem to improve developer-facing guidance, terminology alignment, and workflow examples to better support non-specialists."

This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline. DEFAME performs broad verification, and HAMMER analyses residual or uncertain cases that may contain fine-grained edits. Experiments on DGM4 and ClaimReview samples highlight the complementary strengths of both systems and motivate their fusion.

Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of \"importance\" and \"relevance\" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data. This robustness test gives us deeper insights into the models capabilities to handle erronous data and which XAI module works best in pair with which model for our dataset for hydorcarbon indication."

When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini."

Using the open source AeroBench F-16 simulation benchmark, we train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed. The control objective is encoded as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirement to maintain airspeed within a prescribed band during the final seconds of each maneuver. To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments."

This openness introduces a security misalignment: agents implicitly trust tools exposed by potentially untrusted MCP servers. However, despite its excellent utility, existing agents typically offer limited validation for third-party MCP servers. As a result, agents remain vulnerable to MCP-based attacks that exploit the misalignment between agents and servers throughout the tool invocation lifecycle. In this paper, we propose MCPShield as a plug-in security cognition layer that mitigates this misalignment and ensures agent security when invoking MCP-based tools. Drawing inspiration from human experience-driven tool validation, MCPShield assists agent forms security cognition with metadata-guided probing before invocation. Our method constrains execution within controlled boundaries while cognizing runtime events, and subsequently updates security cognition by reasoning over historical traces after invocation, building on human post-use reflection on tool behavior. Experiments demonstrate that MCPShield exhibits strong generalization in defending against six novel MCP-based attack scenarios across six widely used agentic LLMs, while avoiding false positives on benign servers and incurring low deployment overhead. Overall, our work provides a practical and robust security safeguard for MCP-based tool invocation in open agent ecosystems."

Unlike prior work that assumes fixed clusters or hand-crafted similarity metrics, RMB-CLE derives inter-task similarity directly from cross-task errors, which admit a risk decomposition into functional mismatch and irreducible noise, providing a theoretically grounded mechanism to prevent negative transfer. Tasks are grouped adaptively via agglomerative clustering, and within each cluster, a local ensemble enables robust knowledge sharing while preserving task-specific patterns. Experiments show that RMB-CLE recovers ground-truth clusters in synthetic data and consistently outperforms multi-task, single-task, and pooling-based ensemble methods across diverse real-world and synthetic benchmarks. These results demonstrate that RMB-CLE is not merely a combination of clustering and boosting but a general and scalable framework that establishes a new basis for robust multi-task learning."

In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

In this paper we present a zero-permission attack based on the use of the in-built magnetometer, considering a variety of methods for identifying location-types from their magnetic signature. We implement the proposed approach by using four different techniques for time-series classification. In order to evaluate the approach, we conduct an in-the-wild study to collect a dataset of nearly 70 hours of magnetometer readings with six different phones at 66 locations, each accompanied by a label that classifies it as belonging to one of six selected categories. Finally, using this dataset, we quantify the performance of all models based on two evaluation criteria: (i) leave-a-place-out (using the test data collected from an unknown place), and (ii) leave-a-device-out (using the test data collected from an unknown device) showing that we are able to achieve 40.5% and 39.5% accuracy in classifying the location-type for each evaluation criteria respectively against a random baseline of approximately 16.7% for both of them."

        "abstract": "A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a key component for the transparency of software supply chain; it is a structured inventory of the components, dependencies, and associated metadata of a software artifact. However, an SBOM often contain sensitive information that organizations are unwilling to disclose in full to anyone, for two main concerns: technological risks deriving from exposing proprietary dependencies or unpatched vulnerabilities, and business risks, deriving from exposing architectural strategies. Therefore, delivering a plaintext SBOM may result in the disruption of the intellectual property of a company. To address this, we present VeriSBOM, a trustless, selectively disclosed SBOM framework that provides cryptographic verifiability of SBOMs using zero-knowledge proofs. Within VeriSBOM, third parties can validate specific statements about a delivered software. Respectively, VeriSBOM allows independent third parties to verify if a software contains authentic dependencies distributed by official package managers and that the same dependencies satisfy rigorous policy constraints such as the absence of vulnerable dependencies or the adherence with specific licenses models. VeriSBOM leverages a scalable vector commitment scheme together with folding-based proof aggregation to produce succinct zero-knowledge proofs that attest to security and compliance properties while preserving confidentiality. Crucially, the verification process requires no trust in the SBOM publisher beyond the soundness of the underlying primitives, and third parties can independently check proofs against the public cryptographic commitments. We implement VeriSBOM, analyze its security, and evaluate its performance on real-world package registries. The results show that our method enables scalable, privacy-preserving, and verifiable SBOM sharing and validation."

Addressing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, especially under challenging conditions like unpredictable occlusion, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces LGTrack, a unified UAV tracking framework that integrates dynamic layer selection, efficient feature enhancement, and robust representation learning for occlusions. By employing a novel lightweight Global-Grouped Coordinate Attention (GGCA) module, LGTrack captures long-range dependencies and global contexts, enhancing feature discriminability with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, a lightweight Similarity-Guided Layer Adaptation (SGLA) module replaces knowledge distillation, achieving an optimal balance between tracking precision and inference efficiency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate LGTrack's state-of-the-art real-time speed (258.7 FPS on UAVDT) while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy (82.8\\% precision).

Existing detection defenses typically classify any input with instruction as malicious, leading to misclassification of benign inputs containing instructions that align with the intended task. In this work, we account for the instruction hierarchy and distinguish among three categories: inputs with misaligned instructions, inputs with aligned instructions, and non-instruction inputs. We introduce AlignSentinel, a three-class classifier that leverages features derived from LLM's attention maps to categorize inputs accordingly. To support evaluation, we construct the first systematic benchmark containing inputs from all three categories. Experiments on both our benchmark and existing ones--where inputs with aligned instructions are largely absent--show that AlignSentinel accurately detects inputs with misaligned instructions and substantially outperforms baselines."

        "abstract": "Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges, whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

We present AISA, a lightweight, single-pass defense that activates safety behaviors already latent inside the model rather than treating safety as an add-on. AISA first localizes intrinsic safety awareness via spatiotemporal analysis and shows that intent-discriminative signals are broadly encoded, with especially strong separability appearing in the scaled dot-product outputs of specific attention heads near the final structural tokens before generation. Using a compact set of automatically selected heads, AISA extracts an interpretable prompt-risk score with minimal overhead, achieving detector-level performance competitive with strong proprietary baselines on small (7B) models. AISA then performs logits-level steering: it modulates the decoding distribution in proportion to the inferred risk, ranging from normal generation for benign prompts to calibrated refusal for high-risk requests -- without changing model parameters, adding auxiliary modules, or requiring multi-pass inference. Extensive experiments spanning 13 datasets, 12 LLMs, and 14 baselines demonstrate that AISA improves robustness and transfer while preserving utility and reducing false refusals, enabling safer deployment even for weakly aligned or intentionally risky model variants."

Inspired by hierarchical control, AsyncVLA runs a large foundation model on a remote workstation to provide high-level guidance, while a lightweight, onboard Edge Adapter continuously refines actions at high frequency. To bridge the domain gap between these asynchronous streams, we introduce an end-to-end finetuning protocol and a trajectory re-weighting strategy that prioritizes dynamic interactions. We evaluate our approach on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds. AsyncVLA achieves a 40% higher success rate than state-of-the-art baselines, effectively bridging the gap between the semantic intelligence of large models and the reactivity required for edge robotics."

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of decentralized systems in theWeb3 ecosystem has introduced numerous challenges, particularly in ensuring data security, privacy, and scalability [3, 8]. These systems rely heavily on distributed architectures, requiring robust mechanisms to manage data and interactions among participants securely. One critical aspect of decentralized systems is key management, which is essential for encrypting files, securing database segments, and enabling private transactions. However, securely managing cryptographic keys in a distributed environment poses significant risks, especially when nodes in the network can be compromised [9]. This research proposes a decentralized database scheme specifically designed for secure and private key management. Our approach ensures that cryptographic keys are not stored explicitly at any location, preventing their discovery even if an attacker gains control of multiple nodes. Instead of traditional storage, keys are encoded and distributed using the BFLUT (Bloom Filter for Private Look-Up Tables) algorithm [7], which enables secure retrieval without direct exposure. The system leverages OrbitDB [4], IPFS [1], and IPNS [10] for decentralized data management, providing robust support for consistency, scalability, and simultaneous updates. By combining these technologies, our scheme enhances both security and privacy while maintaining high performance and reliability. Our findings demonstrate the system's capability to securely manage keys, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure privacy, making it a foundational solution for Web3 applications requiring decentralized security."

However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment."

Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models."

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured."

To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks."

        "abstract": "In recent years, the widespread adoption of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), particularly in sensitive environments, has raised considerable privacy concerns. Of particular importance are membership inference attacks (MIAs), which exploit behavioral discrepancies between training and non-training data to determine whether a specific record was included in the model's training set, thereby presenting significant privacy risks. Although existing defenses, such as adversarial regularization, DP-SGD, and MemGuard, assist in mitigating these threats, they often entail trade-offs such as compromising utility, increased computational requirements, or inconsistent protection against diverse attack vectors.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel inference-time defense mechanism called Neighborhood Blending, which mitigates MIAs without retraining the model or incurring significant computational overhead. Our approach operates post-training by smoothing the model's confidence outputs based on the neighborhood of a queried sample. By averaging predictions from similar training samples selected using differentially private sampling, our method establishes a consistent confidence pattern, rendering members and non-members indistinguishable to an adversary while maintaining high utility. Significantly, Neighborhood Blending maintains label integrity (zero label loss) and ensures high utility through an adaptive, \"pay-as-you-go\" distortion strategy. It is a model-agnostic approach that offers a practical, lightweight solution that enhances privacy without sacrificing model utility. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models, we demonstrate that our defense significantly reduces MIA success rates while preserving model performance, outperforming existing post-hoc defenses like MemGuard and training-time techniques like DP-SGD in terms of utility retention."

        "abstract": "As self-driving technology advances toward widespread adoption, determining safe operational thresholds across varying environmental conditions becomes critical for public safety. This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained."

Under the unified protocol, we conduct large-scale evaluations on representative cascaded and end-to-end retrieval systems. Experimental results show that retrieval performance decreases as noise increases, with substantially different drops across systems.

However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments."

Recent advances in deep learning have opened promising opportunities to enhance binary analysis by capturing latent features and disclosing underlying code semantics. Despite the growing number of binary analysis models based on machine learning, their robustness to adversarial code transformations at the binary level remains underexplored. We evaluate the robustness of deep learning models for the task of binary code similarity detection (BCSD) under semantics-preserving transformations. The unique nature of machine instructions presents distinct challenges compared to the typical input perturbations found in other domains. We introduce asmFooler, a system that evaluates the resilience of BCSD models using a diverse set of adversarial code transformations that preserve functional semantics. We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions."

However, in the literature cloudless analysis is often performed where cloudy images are excluded from machine learning datasets and methods. Such an approach cannot be applied to time sensitive applications, e.g., during natural disasters. A possible solution is to apply cloud removal as a preprocessing step to ensure that cloudfree solutions are not failing under such conditions. But cloud removal methods are still actively researched and suffer from drawbacks, such as generated visual artifacts. Therefore, it is desirable to develop cloud robust methods that are less affected by cloudy weather. Cloud robust methods can be achieved by combining optical data with radar, a modality unaffected by clouds. While many datasets for machine learning combine optical and radar data, most researchers exclude cloudy images. We identify this exclusion from machine learning training and evaluation as a limitation that reduces applicability to cloudy scenarios. To investigate this, we assembled a dataset, named CloudyBigEarthNet (CBEN), of paired optical and radar images with cloud occlusion for training and evaluation. Using average precision (AP) as the evaluation metric, we show that state-of-the-art methods trained on combined clear-sky optical and radar imagery suffer performance drops of 23-33 percentage points when evaluated on cloudy images. We then adapt these methods to cloudy optical data during training, achieving relative improvement of 17.2-28.7 percentage points on cloudy test cases compared with the original approaches.

We identify a critical decoupling failure in current research: the lack of distinction between appearance-based shifts, such as weather and lighting, and structural scene changes. This leaves a fundamental question unanswered: Is the planner failing because of complex road geometry, or simply because it is raining? To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models. Our plug-and-play solution maintains consistent performance across extreme appearance shifts without requiring further fine-tuning. The benchmark and code will be made available."

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks, motivating its extension to vision language models (VLMs). While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning."

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that CLIP model's adversarial robustness in zero-shot classification tasks can be enhanced by adversarially fine-tuning its image encoder with adversarial examples (AEs), which are generated by minimizing the cosine similarity between images and a hand-crafted template (e.g., ''A photo of a {label}''). However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the SKILL$.$md specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries, autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities.

        "abstract": "Non-coherent over-the-air (NCOTA) computation enables low-latency and bandwidth-efficient decentralized optimization by exploiting the average energy superposition property of wireless channels. It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference."

Bidding algorithms that achieve optimal regret have been extensively studied, but their strategic robustness to the seller's manipulation remains relatively underexplored. Bidding algorithms based on no-swap-regret algorithms achieve both desirable properties, but are suboptimal in terms of statistical and computational efficiency. In contrast, online gradient ascent is the only algorithm that achieves $O(\\sqrt{TK})$ regret and strategic robustness [KSS24], where $T$ denotes the number of auctions and $K$ the number of bids.\n  In this paper, we explore whether simple online linear optimization (OLO) algorithms suffice for bidding algorithms with both desirable properties. Our main result shows that sublinear linearized regret is sufficient for strategic robustness. Specifically, we construct simple black-box reductions that convert any OLO algorithm into a strategically robust no-regret bidding algorithm, in both known and unknown value distribution settings. For the known value distribution case, our reduction yields a bidding algorithm that achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log K})$ regret and strategic robustness (with exponential improvement on the $K$-dependence compared to [KSS24]). For the unknown value distribution case, our reduction gives a bidding algorithm with high-probability $O(\\sqrt{T (\\log K+\\log(T/\u03b4)})$ regret and strategic robustness, while removing the bounded density assumption made in [KSS24]."

Prior work primarily focuses on manipulating tool names and descriptions to increase the likelihood of installation by users and selection by LLM agents. However, a successful attack also requires embedding malicious behaviors in the tool's code implementation, which remains largely unexplored.\n  In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first systematic study of malicious tool code implementations. We first propose a taxonomy of malicious tool behaviors based on the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad, tailored to LLM-agent settings. To investigate the severity of the risks posed by attackers exploiting coding LLMs to automatically generate malicious tools, we develop MalTool, a coding-LLM-based framework that synthesizes tools exhibiting specified malicious behaviors, either as standalone tools or embedded within otherwise benign implementations. To ensure functional correctness and structural diversity, MalTool leverages an automated verifier that validates whether generated tools exhibit the intended malicious behaviors and differ sufficiently from prior instances, iteratively refining generations until success. Our evaluation demonstrates that MalTool is highly effective even when coding LLMs are safety-aligned. Using MalTool, we construct two datasets of malicious tools: 1,200 standalone malicious tools and 5,287 real-world tools with embedded malicious behaviors. We further show that existing detection methods, including commercial malware detection approaches such as VirusTotal and methods tailored to the LLM-agent setting, exhibit limited effectiveness at detecting the malicious tools, highlighting an urgent need for new defenses."

Consequently, detecting unknown attacks in realistic IoT deployments remains difficult. To address these limitations, we propose SiamXBERT, a robust and data-efficient Siamese meta-learning framework empowered by a transformer-based language model for unknown attack detection. The proposed approach constructs a dual-modality feature representation by integrating flow-level and packet-level information, enabling richer behavioral modeling while remaining compatible with encrypted traffic. Through meta-learning, the model rapidly adapts to new attack types using only a small number of labeled samples and generalizes to previously unseen behaviors. Extensive experiments on representative IoT intrusion datasets demonstrate that SiamXBERT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings while requiring significantly less training data, achieving up to \\num{78.8}\\% improvement in unknown F1-score. These results highlight the practicality of SiamXBERT for robust unknown attack detection in real-world IoT environments."

The MedExChain scheme ensures that PHR can be shared across chains even under the performance limitations of IoMT devices. Additionally, the scheme incorporates Cryptographic Reverse Firewall (CRF) and a blockchain audit mechanism to defend against both internal and external security threats. The robustness of our scheme is validated through BAN logic, Scyther tool, Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA) and Algorithm Substitution Attack (ASA) security analysis veriffcation.

Its ultra-reliable low-latency configuration targets round-trip times below 1 ms, while optional security controls extend protection across all interfaces, making 5G attractive for mission-critical applications. A key enabler of low latency is the disaggregation of network components, including the RAN, allowing user-plane functions to be deployed nearer to end users. However, this split introduces additional interfaces, whose protection increases latency overhead. In this paper, guided by discussions with a network operator and a 5G manufacturer, we evaluate the latency overhead of enabling optional 5G security controls across internal RAN interfaces and the 5G user plane. To this end, we deploy the first testbed implementing a disaggregated RAN with standardized optional security mechanisms. Our results show that disaggregated RAN deployments retain a latency advantage over monolithic designs, even with security enabled. However, achieving sub-1 ms round-trip times remains challenging, as cryptographic overhead alone can already exceed this target."

However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models."

When excessive signal degradation occurs, regeneration is required through regenerators installed at selected network nodes. In this work, both network links and nodes are subject to uncertainty. The installation costs of regenerators are modeled using a budgeted uncertainty set. In addition, link lengths follow a dynamic budgeted uncertainty set introduced in this paper, where deviations may vary over time. Robust optimization seeks solutions whose performance is guaranteed under all scenarios represented by the underlying uncertainty set. Accordingly, the objective is to identify a minimum-cost subset of nodes for regenerator deployment that ensures full network connectivity, even under the worst possible realizations of uncertainty. To solve the problem, we first formulate it within a robust optimization framework, and then develop scalable solution methods based on column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization. In addition, we formulate a learning-based hide-and-seek game to further analyze the problem structure. The proposed approaches are evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations.

        "abstract": "We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from statistical robust filters, which treat all state-space regions identically, and from constrained filters, which bound states rather than modulating observation trust. The approach is especially relevant in non-ergodic or data-scarce settings where only a single realization is available and statistical methods alone cannot learn the noise structure. We implement gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Monte Carlo benchmarks (100 replications) on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well with 10% outlier contamination show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon test). A naive topological baseline using only well positions achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even with 50% parameter errors, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011]) and showing that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement."

By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment. When per-sample detection fails against subtle corruption, contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods, with the advantage growing as corruption becomes harder to detect."

To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations.

These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $\u03b1$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can infer private user attributes (e.g., age, location, gender) from user-generated text shared online, enabling rapid and large-scale privacy breaches. Existing anonymization-based defenses are coarse-grained, lacking word-level precision in anonymizing privacy-leaking elements. Moreover, they are inherently limited as altering user text to hide sensitive cues still allows attribute inference to occur through models' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a unified defense framework that combines fine-grained anonymization (TRACE) with inference-preventing optimization (RPS). TRACE leverages attention mechanisms and inference chain generation to identify and anonymize privacy-leaking textual elements, while RPS employs a lightweight two-stage optimization strategy to induce model rejection behaviors, thereby preventing attribute inference. Evaluations across diverse LLMs show that TRACE-RPS reduces attribute inference accuracy from around 50\\% to below 5\\% on open-source models. In addition, our approach offers strong cross-model generalization, prompt-variation robustness, and utility-privacy tradeoffs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-Yan/TRACE-RPS."

        "author": "Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali, and Evangelos E. Papalexakis",
        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11495v1",
        "abstract": "Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical security challenge with the widespread deployment of conversational AI systems. Adversarial users exploit these models through carefully crafted prompts to elicit restricted or unsafe outputs, a phenomenon commonly referred to as Jailbreaking. Despite numerous proposed defense mechanisms, attackers continue to develop adaptive prompting strategies, and existing models remain vulnerable. This motivates approaches that examine the internal behavior of LLMs rather than relying solely on prompt-level defenses. In this work, we study jailbreaking from both security and interpretability perspectives by analyzing how internal representations differ between jailbreak and benign prompts. We conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis across multiple open-source models, including GPT-J, LLaMA, Mistral, and the state-space model Mamba, and identify consistent latent-space patterns associated with harmful inputs. We then propose a tensor-based latent representation framework that captures structure in hidden activations and enables lightweight jailbreak detection without model fine-tuning or auxiliary LLM-based detectors. We further demonstrate that the latent signals can be used to actively disrupt jailbreak execution at inference time. On an abliterated LLaMA-3.1-8B model, selectively bypassing high-susceptibility layers blocks 78% of jailbreak attempts while preserving benign behavior on 94% of benign prompts. This intervention operates entirely at inference time and introduces minimal overhead, providing a scalable foundation for achieving stronger coverage by incorporating additional attack distributions or more refined susceptibility thresholds. Our results provide evidence that jailbreak behavior is rooted in identifiable internal structures and suggest a complementary, architecture-agnostic direction for improving LLM security."

        "abstract": "Mining is rapidly evolving into an AI driven cyber physical ecosystem where safety and operational reliability depend on robust perception, trustworthy distributed intelligence, and continuous monitoring of miners and equipment. However, real world mining environments impose severe constraints, including poor illumination, GPS denied conditions, irregular underground topologies and intermittent connectivity. These factors degrade perception accuracy, disrupt situational awareness and weaken distributed learning systems. At the same time, emerging cyber physical threats such as backdoor triggers, sensor spoofing, label flipping attacks, and poisoned model updates further jeopardize operational safety as mines adopt autonomous vehicles, humanoid assistance, and federated learning for collaborative intelligence. Energy constrained sensors also experience uneven battery depletion, creating blind spots in safety coverage and disrupting hazard detection pipelines. This paper presents a vision for a Unified Smart Safety and Security Architecture that integrates multimodal perception, secure federated learning, reinforcement learning, DTN enabled communication, and energy aware sensing into a cohesive safety framework. We introduce five core modules: Miner Finder, Multimodal Situational Awareness, Backdoor Attack Monitor, TrustFed LFD, and IoT driven Equipment Health Monitoring. These modules collectively address miner localization, hazard understanding, federated robustness, and predictive maintenance. Together, they form an end to end framework capable of guiding miners through obstructed pathways, identifying compromised models or sensors, and ensuring mission critical equipment reliability. This work outlines a comprehensive research vision for building a resilient and trustworthy intelligent mining system capable of maintaining operational continuity under adversarial conditions."

        "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

Intel provided guidance and support, including documentation and updated TDX 1.5 source code. Unlike the previous review, this time, we had access to a compute node capable of running TDX to develop a toolkit for live testing and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) generation. Furthermore, we integrated Gemini for analysis and NotebookLM to efficiently navigate complex specifications.\n  This assessment resulted in the discovery of one vulnerability that enables a VMM to fully compromise a TD, and four vulnerabilities that enable a malicious VMM or TD to leak confidential memory of the Intel TDX Module. Several other security weaknesses and/or bugs were identified but not categorized as vulnerabilities despite having some impact on security.\n  Beyond presenting the technical details of multiple bugs and vulnerabilities in this report, these findings underscore that confidential computing, like other security measures, requires iterative refinement and complementary security controls to harden it, in line with a defense-in-depth approach."

Such defenses can provably block unsafe actions by enforcing confidentiality and integrity policies, but currently appear costly: they reduce task completion rates and increase token usage compared to probabilistic defenses. We argue that existing evaluations miss a key benefit of system-level defenses: reduced reliance on human oversight. We introduce autonomy metrics to quantify this benefit: the fraction of consequential actions an agent can execute without human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval while preserving security. To increase autonomy, we design a security-aware agent that (i) introduces richer HITL interactions, and (ii) explicitly plans for both task progress and policy compliance. We implement this agent design atop an existing information-flow control defense against prompt injection and evaluate it on the AgentDojo and WASP benchmarks. Experiments show that this approach yields higher autonomy without sacrificing utility."

Our method reduces the average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, restoring strong duality and enabling tractable equilibrium computation. We prove novel Lipschitz and Lipschitz-smoothness properties for general policy parameterizations that extends to infinite state spaces. To address infinite-horizon gradient estimation, we introduce a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\u03b5^{-2})$ sample complexity, a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-2})$ improvement over prior work. Building on this, we design a projected gradient descent algorithm for s-rectangular uncertainty ($\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-5})$) and a Frank--Wolfe algorithm for non-rectangular uncertainty ($\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-4})$ discounted, $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-10.5})$ average reward), significantly improving prior results in both the discounted setting and average reward setting.

It also provides the first such guarantees in the average reward setting and improves existing bounds for discounted robust MDPs."

        "abstract": "Estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems is crucial for outcome optimization. In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD. This work highlights the potential of hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models for robust intervention optimization in complex, real-world dynamical systems."

However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations."

This paper presents a systematic security analysis of four emerging AI agent communication protocols. First, we develop a structured threat modeling analysis that examines protocol architectures, trust assumptions, interaction patterns, and lifecycle behaviors to identify protocol-specific and cross-protocol risk surfaces. Second, we introduce a qualitative risk assessment framework that identifies twelve protocol-level risks and evaluates security posture across the creation, operation, and update phases through systematic assessment of likelihood, impact, and overall protocol risk, with implications for secure deployment and future standardization. Third, we provide a measurement-driven case study on MCP that formalizes the risk of missing mandatory validation/attestation for executable components as a falsifiable security claim by quantifying wrong-provider tool execution under multi-server composition across representative resolver policies. Collectively, our results highlight key design-induced risk surfaces and provide actionable guidance for secure deployment and future standardization of agent communication ecosystems."

Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.\n  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains.

While single-turn detection has been extensively studied, no published formula exists for aggregating per-turn pattern scores into a conversation-level risk score at the proxy layer -- without invoking an LLM. We identify a fundamental flaw in the intuitive weighted-average approach: it converges to the per-turn score regardless of turn count, meaning a 20-turn persistent attack scores identically to a single suspicious turn. Drawing on analogies from change-point detection (CUSUM), Bayesian belief updating, and security risk-based alerting, we propose peak + accumulation scoring -- a formula combining peak single-turn risk, persistence ratio, and category diversity. Evaluated on 10,654 multi-turn conversations -- 588 attacks sourced from WildJailbreak adversarial prompts and 10,066 benign conversations from WildChat -- the formula achieves 90.8% recall at 1.20% false positive rate with an F1 of 85.9%. A sensitivity analysis over the persistence parameter reveals a phase transition at rho ~ 0.4, where recall jumps 12 percentage points with negligible FPR increase.

The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%.

On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation."

Current implementations predominantly rely on a \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains. These results demonstrate Aura as a viable, secure alternative to the \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm."

        "abstract": "Mobile gaming applications (apps) have become increasingly pervasive, including a growing number of games designed for children. Despite their popularity, these apps often integrate complex analytics, advertising, and attribution infrastructures that may introduce privacy and security risks. Existing research has primarily focused on tracking behaviors or monetization models, leaving configuration-level privacy exposure and children-oriented apps underexplored. In this study, we conducted a comparative static analysis of Android mobile games to investigate privacy and security risks beyond permission usage. The analysis follows a three-phase methodology comprising (i) designing study protocol, (ii) Android Package Kit (APK) collection and static inspection, and (iii) data analysis. We examined permissions, manifest-level configuration properties (e.g., backup settings, cleartext network traffic, and exported components), and embedded third-party Software Development Kit (SDK) ecosystems across children-oriented and general-audience mobile games. The extracted indicators are synthesized into qualitative privacy-risk categories to support comparative reporting. The results showed that while children-oriented games often request fewer permissions, they frequently exhibit configuration-level risks and embed third-party tracking SDKs similar to general-audience games. Architectural and configuration decisions play a critical role in shaping privacy risks, particularly for apps targeting children. This study contributes a holistic static assessment of privacy exposure in mobile games and provides actionable insights for developers, platform providers, and researchers seeking to improve privacy-by-design practices in mobile applications."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation in fast, informal development workflows, often referred to as vibe coding, where speed and convenience are prioritized, and security requirements are rarely made explicit. In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control.\n  We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality."

The IoT systems operate in different conditions, and security issues continue to increase. This paper presents the comprehensive security framework for IoT that should integrate the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with the semantic middleware and blockchain technologies. The work provides a systematic analysis of the architectural patterns based on more than twenty recent research works and the existing standards, and it proposes a layered security architecture. The architecture includes the hardware rooted trust at peripheral level, the zero trust principles at network level, and the semantic security mechanisms at application level. The framework focuses on practical implementation aspects such as the performance overhead, interoperability requirements, and the compliance with new regulations, which are very important for the real IoT deployments. The paper reports quantitative metrics which include the cryptographic performance on Cortex-M class microcontrollers with the detection accuracy rates and the energy consumption values. The proposed architecture shows that cross-layer security integration can provide defense in depth while it still satisfies the constraints of resource-limited IoT environments.

        "abstract": "Assortment optimization is a fundamental challenge in modern retail and recommendation systems, where the goal is to select a subset of products that maximizes expected revenue under complex customer choice behaviors. While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning. Our work bridges the gap between robustness and statistical efficiency in assortment learning, contributing new insights and tools for reliable assortment optimization under uncertainty."

        "abstract": "Code models are increasingly adopted in software development but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks via poisoned training data. Existing backdoor attacks on code models face a fundamental trade-off between transferability and stealthiness. Static trigger-based attacks insert fixed dead code patterns that transfer well across models and datasets but are easily detected by code-specific defenses. In contrast, dynamic trigger-based attacks adaptively generate context-aware triggers to evade detection but suffer from poor cross-dataset transferability. Moreover, they rely on unrealistic assumptions of identical data distributions between poisoned and victim training data, limiting their practicality. To overcome these limitations, we propose Sharpness-aware Transferable Adversarial Backdoor (STAB), a novel attack that achieves both transferability and stealthiness without requiring complete victim data. STAB is motivated by the observation that adversarial perturbations in flat regions of the loss landscape transfer more effectively across datasets than those in sharp minima. To this end, we train a surrogate model using Sharpness-Aware Minimization to guide model parameters toward flat loss regions, and employ Gumbel-Softmax optimization to enable differentiable search over discrete trigger tokens for generating context-aware adversarial triggers. Experiments across three datasets and two code models show that STAB outperforms prior attacks in terms of transferability and stealthiness. It achieves a 73.2% average attack success rate after defense, outperforming static trigger-based attacks that fail under defense. STAB also surpasses the best dynamic trigger-based attack by 12.4% in cross-dataset attack success rate and maintains performance on clean inputs."

In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

The key innovation of GRAB-MDM is a {view}-dependent bandwidth selection strategy that adapts to the geometry and noise level of each view, enabling a stable and principled construction of multiview diffusion operators. Under a common-manifold model, we establish asymptotic convergence results and show that the adaptive bandwidths lead to provably robust recovery of the shared intrinsic structure, even when noise levels and sensor dimensions differ across views. Numerical experiments demonstrate that GRAB-MDM significantly improves robustness and embedding quality compared with fixed-bandwidth and equal-bandwidth baselines, and usually outperform existing algorithms. The proposed framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for multiview sensor fusion in high-dimensional noisy environments."

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data.

Building on these primitives, we formalize a policy algebra with four proven theorems providing protocol-level Byzantine resistance--even adversarial agents cannot violate organizational policies. Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees. Evaluation against representative attacks spanning 6 exhaustive categories achieves 100% detection with zero false positives and nominal overhead.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment."

However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks."

In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning."

Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff."

Based on LoRD, we build up a defense pipeline that applies the learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attack algorithms. Our method ensures that the LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images.

In this paper, we introduce a lightweight adversarial agent that implements strategies (policies) trained via reinforcement learning (RL) that learn to evade ML-based NIDS without requiring online optimization. This attack proceeds by (1) offline training, where the agent learns to evade a surrogate ML model by perturbing malicious flows using network traffic data assumed to be collected via reconnaissance, then (2) deployment, where the trained agent is used in a compromised device controlled by an attacker to evade ML-based NIDS using learned attack strategies. We evaluate our approach across diverse NIDS and several white-, gray-, and black-box threat models. We demonstrate that attacks using these lightweight agents can be highly effective (reaching up to 48.9% attack success rate), extremely fast (requiring as little as 5.72ms to craft an attack), and require negligible resources (e.g., 0.52MB of memory).

Attacks against 5G standalone (SA) commonly use fake base stations (FBS), which need to operate at a very high output power level to lure victim phones to connect to them and are thus highly detectable. In this paper, we introduce 5Gone, a powerful software-defined radio (SDR)-based uplink overshadowing attack method against 5G-SA. 5Gone exploits deficiencies in the 3GPP standard to perform surgical, covert denial-of-service, privacy, and downgrade attacks. Uplink overshadowing means that an attacker is transmitting at exactly the same time and frequency as the victim UE, but with a slightly higher output power. 5Gone runs on a COTS x86 computer without any need for dedicated hardware acceleration and can overshadow commercial 100 MHz cells with an E2E latency of less than 500$\u03bc$s, which up to now has not been possible with any software-based UE implementation. We demonstrate that 5Gone is highly scalable, even when many UEs are connecting in parallel, and finally evaluate the attacks end-to-end against 7 phone models and three different chipset vendors both in our lab and in the real-world on public gNodeBs."

To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms."

While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems.

        "abstract": "Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines."

First, we formalize the conceptual and mathematical foundations of robustness, highlighting the interpretations and relations across robust statistics, optimization, and machine learning. Key techniques, such as robust estimation and testing, distributionally robust optimization, and regularized and adversary training, are investigated. Together, the costs of robustness in system design, for example, the compromised nominal performances and the extra computational burdens, are discussed. Second, we review recent robust signal processing solutions for WSC that address model mismatch, data scarcity, adversarial perturbation, and distributional shift. Specific applications include robust ranging-based localization, modality sensing, channel estimation, receive combining, waveform design, and federated learning. Through this effort, we aim to introduce the classical developments and recent advances in robustness theory to the general signal processing community, exemplifying how robust statistical, optimization, and machine learning approaches can address the uncertainties inherent in WSC systems."

        "abstract": "Understanding the reliability of natural language generation is critical for deploying foundation models in security-sensitive domains. While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications."

While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}.\n  To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.\n  Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.\n  Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\\%) and Gemini (59.5\\%).\n  These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques.

To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "The widespread use of publicly available pre-trained encoders from self-supervised learning (SSL) has exposed a critical vulnerability: their susceptibility to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs), which are crafted without knowledge of the downstream tasks but capable of misleading downstream models. While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property."

We introduce \\emph{conditioned occupancy measures}, which remain stable across episodes even with adversarial transitions, and use them to design two algorithms. The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\\tilde{O}(H S^\u039b\\sqrt{K S A^{\u039b+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon. The second, assuming the adversarial steps are consecutive, improves the dependence on $S$ to $\\tilde{O}(H\\sqrt{K S^{3} A^{\u039b+1}})$. We further give a $K^{2/3}$-regret reduction that removes the need to know which steps are the $\u039b$ adversarial steps. We also characterize the regret of adversarial MDPs in the \\emph{fully adversarial} setting ($\u039b=H-1$) both for full-information and bandit feedback, and provide almost matching upper and lower bounds (slightly strengthen existing lower bounds, and clarify how different feedback structures affect the hardness of learning)."

Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability."

Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses."

Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches."

We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models.

Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties.

Such attacks on randomness sources can be extremely covert, and have a history of exploitation in real-world systems. In this work, we examine the role of randomness in the machine learning development pipeline from an adversarial point of view, and analyze the implementations of PRNGs in major machine learning frameworks. We present RNGGuard to help machine learning engineers secure their systems with low effort. RNGGuard statically analyzes a target library's source code and identifies instances of random functions and modules that use them. At runtime, RNGGuard enforces secure execution of random functions by replacing insecure function calls with RNGGuard's implementations that meet security specifications. Our evaluations show that RNGGuard presents a practical approach to close existing gaps in securing randomness sources in machine learning systems."

Because NPE is estimated under the training data distribution, it is susceptible to misspecification when observations deviate from the training distribution. Many robust SBI approaches address this by modifying NPE training or introducing error models, coupling robustness to the inference network and compromising amortization and modularity. We introduce minimum-distance summaries, a plug-in robust NPE method that adapts queried test-time summaries independently of the pretrained NPE. Leveraging the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a distance between observed data and a summary-conditional predictive distribution, the adapted summary inherits strong robustness properties from the MMD. We demonstrate that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently with random Fourier feature approximations, yielding a lightweight, model-free test-time adaptation procedure. We provide theoretical guarantees for the robustness of our algorithm and empirically evaluate it on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating substantial robustness gains with minimal additional overhead."

To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $\u03c7_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $\u03c7_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes.

(2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\\rightarrow$ urban and day $\\rightarrow$ night ($\\sim 31\\%$ each); actor swaps $\\sim 10\\%$, moderate rain $\\sim 7\\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\\% \\rightarrow 70.1\\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies."

While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like \"Bingo\". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent \"Cognitive Gap\" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era."

        "abstract": "Though not yet widely deployed, password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols have been the subject of several recent standardization efforts, partly because of their resistance against various guessing attacks, but also because they do not require a public-key infrastructure (PKI), making them naturally resistant against PKI failures. The goal of this paper is to reevaluate the PAKE model by noting that the absence of a PKI -- or, more generally, of a mechanism aside from the password for authenticating the server -- makes such protocols vulnerable to reverse online guessing attacks, in which an adversary attempts to validate password guesses by impersonating a server. While their logic is similar to traditional guessing, where the attacker impersonates a client, reverse guessing poses a unique risk because the burden of detection is shifted to the clients, rendering existing defenses against traditional guessing moot. Our results demonstrate that reverse guessing is particularly effective when an adversary attacks clients indiscriminately, such as in phishing or password-spraying attacks, or for applications with automated login processes or a universal password, such as WPA3-SAE. Our analysis suggests that stakeholders should, by default, authenticate the server using more stringent measures than just the user's password, and that a password-only mode of operation should be a last resort against catastrophic security failures when other authentication mechanisms are not available."

To this end, we propose generative model-based ambiguity sets that capture various adversarial distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency with the nominal distribution. Building on this generative ambiguity modeling, we propose DRO with Generative Ambiguity Set (GAS-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner maximization over the parameterized generative model space. We formally establish the stationary convergence performance of GAS-DRO. We implement GAS-DRO with a diffusion model and empirically demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance in ML tasks."

StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results expose significant robustness gaps in current AI-text detection and establish StealthRL as a principled adversarial evaluation protocol.

        "abstract": "Regression neural networks (NNs) are most commonly trained by minimizing the mean squared prediction error, which is highly sensitive to outliers and data contamination. Existing robust training methods for regression NNs are often limited in scope and rely primarily on empirical validation, with only a few offering partial theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new robust learning framework for regression NNs based on the $\u03b2$-divergence (also known as the density power divergence) which we call `rRNet'. It applies to a broad class of regression NNs, including models with non-smooth activation functions and error densities, and recovers the classical maximum likelihood learning as a special case. The rRNet is implemented via an alternating optimization scheme, for which we establish convergence guarantees to stationary points under mild, verifiable conditions. The (local) robustness of rRNet is theoretically characterized through the influence functions of both the parameter estimates and the resulting rRNet predictor, which are shown to be bounded for suitable choices of the tuning parameter $\u03b2$, depending on the error density. We further prove that rRNet attains the optimal 50\\% asymptotic breakdown point at the assumed model for all $\u03b2\\in(0, 1]$, providing a strong global robustness guarantee that is largely absent for existing NN learning methods. Our theoretical results are complemented by simulation experiments and real-data analyses, illustrating practical advantages of rRNet over existing approaches in both function approximation problems and prediction tasks with noisy observations."

        "abstract": "The accuracy of machine learning interatomic potentials suffers from reference data that contains numerical noise. Often originating from unconverged or inconsistent electronic-structure calculations, this noise is challenging to identify. Existing mitigation strategies such as manual filtering or iterative refinement of outliers, require either substantial expert effort or multiple expensive retraining cycles, making them difficult to scale to large datasets. Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes."

        "abstract": "Large language models are commonly trained through multi-stage post-training: first via RLHF, then fine-tuned for other downstream objectives. Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.\n  We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning."

We address this challenge in a client-server setting where an untrusted server hosts an autoregressive Transformer and the client requires cryptographic protection for both inputs and inference. We present CryptoGen, the first system to enable scalable privacy-preserving neural generation with persistent encrypted key-value (KV) cache reuse. Discriminative-task secure inference systems incur quadratic latency and memory growth when adapted to autoregressive decoding due to the lack of native encrypted KV-cache support. In contrast, CryptoGen achieves near-linear scaling by securely reusing and updating encrypted KV caches throughout generation. CryptoGen integrates homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to support both prefilling and generation. Key techniques include a unified encrypted KV-cache framework, heterogeneous SIMD encodings for different phases, optimized cipher-cipher matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations, and efficient noise refresh and ciphertext concatenation mechanisms. Evaluation on generative Transformer models trained on WikiText-2, PTB, and LAMBADA shows that for input lengths of 128-512 tokens, CryptoGen achieves 4.4x-7.6x lower per-token latency than state-of-the-art discriminative secure inference systems, while maintaining near-linear latency and memory scaling, with advantages increasing for longer sequences.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08706v1",
        "abstract": "The prospect of AI systems that I call ideal emotion recognition technologies (ERTs) is often defended on the assumption that social life would benefit from increased affective transparency. This paper challenges that assumption by examining the technosocial risks posed by ideal ERTs, understood as multimodal systems capable of reliably inferring inner affective states in real time. Drawing on philosophical accounts of emotional expression and social practice, as well as empirical work in affective science and social psychology, I argue that the appeal of such systems rests on a misunderstanding of the social functions of emotional expression. Emotional expressions function not only as read-outs of inner states, but also as tools for coordinating action, enabling moral repair, sustaining interpersonal trust, and supporting collective norms. These functions depend on a background of partial opacity and epistemic friction. When deployed in socially authoritative or evaluative contexts, ideal ERTs threaten this expressive space by collapsing epistemic friction, displacing relational meaning with technology-mediated affective profiles, and narrowing the space for aspirational and role-sensitive expressions. The result is a drift towards affective determinism and ambient forms of affective auditing, which undermine both social cohesion and individual agency. I argue that, although it is intuitive to think that increasing accuracy would legitimise such systems, in the case of ERTs accuracy does not straightforwardly justify their deployment, and may, in some contexts, provide a reason for regulatory restraint. I conclude by defending a function-first regulatory approach that treats expressive discretion and intentional emotional expression as constitutive of certain social goods, and that accordingly seeks to protect these goods from excessive affective legibility."

While recent runtime defenses attempt to disrupt this process via output perturbation, most either require access to model parameters or fail when attackers adapt their tactics. In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process. We provide theoretical guarantees of DLD's defense capability and validate its effectiveness through experiments on ImageNet, demonstrating that DLD consistently outperforms prior defenses--even under worst-case adaptive attacks--while preserving the model's predicted labels."

We show that this composition introduces a distinct security failure mode: a vector-retrieved \"seed\" chunk can pivot via entity links into sensitive graph neighborhoods, causing cross-tenant data leakage that does not occur in vector-only retrieval. We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure.\n  We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition.\n  We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead. Our results indicate the root cause is boundary enforcement, not inherently complex defenses: two individually secure retrieval components can compose into an insecure system unless authorization is re-checked at the transition point."

Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient."

However, existing approaches often rely heavily on README files and other metadata, which are frequently missing, limiting their applicability in real-world large-scale settings. We present DRAGON, a repository classifier designed for very large and diverse software collections. It operates entirely on lightweight signals commonly stored in version control systems: file and directory names, and optionally the README when available. In repository classification at scale, DRAGON improves F1@5 from 54.8% to 60.8%, surpassing the state of the art. DRAGON remains effective even when README files are absent, with performance degrading by only 6% w.r.t. when they are present. This robustness makes it practical for real-world settings where documentation is sparse or inconsistent. Furthermore, many of the remaining classification errors are near misses, where predicted labels are semantically close to the correct topics. This property increases the practical value of the predictions in real-world software collections, where suggesting a few related topics can still guide search and discovery. As a byproduct of developing DRAGON, we also release the largest open dataset to date for repository classification, consisting of 825 thousand repositories with associated ground-truth topics, sourced from the Software Heritage archive, providing a foundation for future large-scale and language-agnostic research on software repository understanding."

To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data. Empirical results show that CreDRO consistently outperforms existing credal methods on tasks such as out-of-distribution detection across multiple benchmarks and selective classification in medical applications."

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm widely adopted in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks."

This direction is particularly promising for diffusion-style code models, whose approach provides a natural elegant opportunity for modular, hierarchical security enforcement, allowing us to combine lower-latency generation techniques with generating secure-by-construction code."

        "abstract": "Although large language model (LLM)-based agents, exemplified by OpenClaw, are increasingly evolving from task-oriented systems into personalized AI assistants for solving complex real-world tasks, their practical deployment also introduces severe security risks. However, existing agent security research and evaluation frameworks primarily focus on synthetic or task-centric settings, and thus fail to accurately capture the attack surface and risk propagation mechanisms of personalized agents in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose Personalized Agent Security Bench (PASB), an end-to-end security evaluation framework tailored for real-world personalized agents. Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments. The code for the proposed PASB framework is available at https://github.com/AstorYH/PASB."

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{D$^2$-VR}, a single-image diffusion-based video-restoration framework with low-step inference. To obtain precise temporal guidance under severe degradation, we first design a Degradation-Robust Flow Alignment (DRFA) module that leverages confidence-aware attention to filter unreliable motion cues. We then incorporate an adversarial distillation paradigm to compress the diffusion sampling trajectory into a rapid few-step regime. Finally, a synergistic optimization strategy is devised to harmonize perceptual quality with rigorous temporal consistency.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13293v1",
        "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have advanced perception in autonomous driving (AD), but they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats. These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates \"corrective driving prompts\" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation. Our code is available at https://github.com/PXX/NutVLM."

        "abstract": "Event cameras have been widely adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and human-computer interaction. A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems. Nevertheless, research into adversarial attacks on events is scarce. This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \\textbf{M}otion-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{Adv}ersarial framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate adversarial events by leveraging point cloud representations. MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems."

        "abstract": "The need to rapidly solve PDEs in engineering design workflows has spurred the rise of neural surrogate models. In particular, neural operator models provide a discretization-invariant surrogate by retaining the infinite-dimensional, functional form of their arguments. Despite improved throughput, such methods lack guarantees on accuracy, unlike classical numerical PDE solvers. Optimizing engineering designs under these potentially miscalibrated surrogates thus runs the risk of producing designs that perform poorly upon deployment. In a similar vein, there is growing interest in automated decision-making under black-box predictors in the finite-dimensional setting, where a similar risk of suboptimality exists under poorly calibrated models. For this reason, methods have emerged that produce adversarially robust decisions under uncertainty estimates of the upstream model. One such framework leverages conformal prediction, a distribution-free post-hoc uncertainty quantification method, to provide these estimates due to its natural pairing with black-box predictors. We herein extend this line of conformally robust decision-making to infinite-dimensional function spaces. We first extend the typical conformal prediction guarantees over finite-dimensional spaces to infinite-dimensional Sobolev spaces. We then demonstrate how such uncertainty can be leveraged to robustly formulate engineering design tasks and characterize the suboptimality of the resulting robust optimal designs. We then empirically demonstrate the generality of our functional conformal coverage method across a diverse collection of PDEs, including the Poisson and heat equations, and showcase the significant improvement of such robust design in a quantum state discrimination task."

Such explicit reasoning requires extended context lengths, resulting in substantially higher resource consumption. Prior work has shown that adversarially crafted inputs can trigger redundant reasoning processes, exposing LRMs to resource-exhaustion vulnerabilities. However, the reasoning process itself, especially its reflective component, has received limited attention, even though it can lead to over-reflection and consume excessive computing power. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning."

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are now a core part of modern AI. Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."

AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions.

For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data. Each level contains specific data types, based on their expected ability to contribute to capabilities of concern when used to train AI models. For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data. In a world with widely accessible computational and coding resources, data controls may be among the most high-leverage interventions available to reduce the proliferation of concerning biological AI capabilities."

In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known. Experiments in 6-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em and competitive Pokemon show consistent improvements in long-term return over strong LLM and RL baselines, and graceful degradation under controlled prediction noise."

This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results. The proposed framework is extensible to more complex constraint settings, laying the groundwork for future advances in counterfactual reasoning under nonconvex quadratic formulations."

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework."

However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA.

To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings.

Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost."

To address the above concerns, intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be used to defend against malicious aircraft intrusions in LAE. Whereas, due to the heterogeneous data, dynamic environment, and resource-constrained devices within LAE, current IDS face challenges in detection accuracy, adaptability, and resource utilization ratio. In this regard, due to the inherent ability to combine the strengths of multiple models, ensemble learning can realize more robust and diverse anomaly detection further enhance IDS accuracy, thereby improving robustness and efficiency of the secure LAE. Unlike single-model approaches, ensemble learning can leverage the collective knowledge of its constituent models to effectively defend the malicious aircraft intrusion attacks. Specifically, this paper investigates ensemble learning for secure LAE, covering research focuses, solutions, and a case study. We first establish the rationale for ensemble learning and then review research areas and potential solutions, demonstrating the necessities and benefits of applying ensemble learning to secure LAE. Subsequently, we propose a framework of ensemble learning-enabled malicious aircrafts tracking in the secure LAE, where its feasibility and effectiveness are evaluated by the designed case study.

        "abstract": "The quality of Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget and the choice of optimization algorithm. Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers. Finally, 3) we provide a theoretical analysis of gradient-based methods for the proxy task of a convex quadratic objective, demonstrating that Chinchilla-style scaling laws emerge naturally as a result of loss decomposition into irreducible, approximation, and optimization errors."

        "abstract": "Machine learning models now influence decisions that directly affect people's lives, making it important to understand not only their predictions, but also how individuals could act to obtain better results. Algorithmic recourse provides actionable input modifications to achieve more favorable outcomes, typically relying on counterfactual explanations to suggest such changes. However, when the Rashomon set - the set of near-optimal models - is large, standard counterfactual explanations can become unreliable, as a recourse action valid for one model may fail under another. We introduce ElliCE, a novel framework for robust algorithmic recourse that optimizes counterfactuals over an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set. The resulting explanations are provably valid over this ellipsoid, with theoretical guarantees on uniqueness, stability, and alignment with key feature directions. Empirically, ElliCE generates counterfactuals that are not only more robust but also more flexible, adapting to user-specified feature constraints while being substantially faster than existing baselines. This provides a principled and practical solution for reliable recourse under model uncertainty, ensuring stable recommendations for users even as models evolve."

Holding the base model fixed, we evaluate eight agent archetypes under persistent multi-turn interaction and observe substantial architectural variation in mean security break rate (MSBR), ranging from $0.29 \\pm 0.04$ (LangGraph) to $0.51 \\pm 0.07$ (AutoGPT). The highest-risk classes are operational: Denial-of-Wallet ($0.62 \\pm 0.08$), Authorization Confusion ($0.54 \\pm 0.10$), Retrieval Poisoning ($0.47 \\pm 0.09$), and Planning Manipulation ($0.44 \\pm 0.11$), while prompt-centric classes remain below $0.20$ under standard settings.

AgentFence reframes agent security around what matters operationally: whether an agent stays within its goal and authority envelope over time."

        "abstract": "Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is crucial for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) deployment but suffers from accuracy degradation caused by weight and activation outliers. Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time."

The framework is designed around practical video-generation constraints, including high rollout cost, temporally compounding failure modes, and feedback that is heterogeneous, uncertain, and often weakly discriminative. By treating optimization as a staged, diagnostic-driven process rather than a collection of isolated tricks, the report summarizes a cohesive recipe for improving perceptual fidelity, temporal coherence, and prompt adherence while preserving the controllability established at initialization.

Through a two-stage optimization process, MemPot generates trap documents that maximize the retrieval probability for attackers while remaining inconspicuous to benign users. We model the detection process as Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) and theoretically prove that MemPot achieves a lower average number of sampling rounds compared to optimal static detectors. Empirically, MemPot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 50% improvement in detection AUROC and an 80% increase in True Positive Rate under low False Positive Rate constraints. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that MemPot incurs zero additional online inference latency and preserves the agent's utility on standard tasks, verifying its superiority in safety, harmlessness, and efficiency."

But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address."

Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability.

Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%.

        "abstract": "Indirect prompt injection threatens LLM agents by embedding malicious instructions in external content, enabling unauthorized actions and data theft. LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.\n  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.\n  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats.

To address this gap, we propose Aegis, a red-teaming framework for the governance, integrity, and security of voice agents. Aegis models the realistic deployment pipeline of voice agents and designs structured adversarial scenarios of critical risks, including privacy leakage, privilege escalation, resource abuse, etc. We evaluate the framework through case studies in banking call centers, IT Support, and logistics. Our evaluation shows that while access controls mitigate data-level risks, voice agents remain vulnerable to behavioral attacks that cannot be addressed through access restrictions alone, even under strict access controls. We observe systematic differences across model families, with open-weight models exhibiting higher susceptibility, underscoring the need for layered defenses that combine access control, policy enforcement, and behavioral monitoring to secure next-generation voice agents."

We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective."

First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles.

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation."

However, a fundamental architectural constraint, that only a limited number of hardware events can be monitored concurrently, creates a significant bottleneck, leading to detection blind spots. Prior work has primarily focused on optimizing machine learning models for a single, statically chosen event set, or on ensembling models over the same feature set. We argue that robustness requires diversifying not only the models, but also the underlying feature sets (i.e., the monitored hardware events) in order to capture a broader spectrum of program behavior. This observation motivates the following research question: Can detection performance be improved by trading temporal granularity for broader coverage, via the strategic scheduling of different feature sets over time? To answer this question, we propose Hydra, a novel detection mechanism that partitions execution traces into time slices and learns an effective schedule of feature sets and corresponding classifiers for deployment. By cycling through complementary feature sets, Hydra mitigates the limitations of a fixed monitoring perspective. Our experimental evaluation shows that Hydra significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-feature-set baselines, achieving a 19.32% improvement in F1 score and a 60.23% reduction in false positive rate. These results underscore the importance of feature-set diversity and establish strategic multi-feature-set scheduling as an effective principle for robust, hardware-assisted malware detection."

This model includes several important hyperparameters, such as the membrane potential threshold and membrane time constant. Both the DNNs and SNNs have proven to be exploitable by backdoor attacks, where an adversary can poison the training dataset with malicious triggers and force the model to behave in an attacker-defined manner. Yet, how an adversary can exploit the unique characteristics of SNNs for backdoor attacks remains underexplored.

We further propose a trigger optimization process to achieve better attack performance while making trigger patterns less perceptible. \\textit{BadSNN} demonstrates superior attack performance on various datasets and architectures, as well as compared with state-of-the-art data poisoning-based backdoor attacks and robustness against common backdoor mitigation techniques.

        "abstract": "High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional scanning enables rapid functional brain imaging but introduces severe spatiotemporal\n  misalignment from coupled scan-direction-dependent domain shift and geometric distortion. Conventional registration methods rely on brightness constancy, an assumption\n  violated under bidirectional scanning, leading to unreliable alignment. A unified scene-appearance separation framework is proposed to jointly address domain shift and\n  spatial misalignment. The proposed architecture separates domain-invariant scene content from domain-specific appearance characteristics, enabling cross-domain\n  reconstruction with geometric preservation. A scene consistency loss promotes geometric correspondence in the latent space, linking domain shift correction with spatial\n  registration within a single framework. For in vivo mouse brain vasculature imaging, the proposed method achieves normalized cross-correlation (NCC) of 0.961 and\n  structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.894, substantially outperforming conventional methods. Ablation studies demonstrate that domain alignment loss is critical,\n  with its removal causing 82% NCC reduction (0.961 to 0.175), while scene consistency and cycle consistency losses provide complementary regularization for optimal\n  performance. The method achieves 11.2 ms inference time per frame (86 fps), substantially exceeding typical OR-PAM acquisition rates and enabling real-time processing.\n  These results suggest that the proposed framework enables robust high-speed bidirectional OR-PAM for reliable quantitative and longitudinal functional imaging.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07154v1",
        "abstract": "Pooling heterogeneous datasets across domains is a common strategy in representation learning, but naive pooling can amplify distributional asymmetries and yield biased estimators, especially in settings where zero-shot generalization is required. We propose a matching framework that selects samples relative to an adaptive centroid and iteratively refines the representation distribution. The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings. Most importantly, we show that these improvements translate to zero-shot medical anomaly detection, one of the extreme forms of data heterogeneity and asymmetry. The code is available on https://github.com/AyushRoy2001/Beyond-Pooling."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07126v1",
        "abstract": "Synthetic tabular data has gained attention for enabling privacy-preserving data sharing. While substantial progress has been made in single-table synthetic generation where data are modeled at the row or item level, most real-world data exists in relational databases where a user's information spans items across multiple interconnected tables. Recent advances in synthetic relational data generation have emerged to address this complexity, yet release of these data introduce unique privacy challenges as information can be leaked not only from individual items but also through the relationships that comprise a complete user entity.\n  To address this, we propose a novel Membership Inference Attack (MIA) setting to audit the empirical user-level privacy of synthetic relational data and show that single-table MIAs that audit at an item level underestimate user-level privacy leakage. We then propose Multi-Table Membership Inference Attack (MT-MIA), a novel adversarial attack under a No-Box threat model that targets learned representations of user entities via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks. By incorporating all connected items for a user, MT-MIA better targets user-level vulnerabilities induced by inter-tabular relationships than existing attacks. We evaluate MT-MIA on a range of real-world multi-table datasets and demonstrate that this vulnerability exists in state-of-the-art relational synthetic data generators, employing MT-MIA to additionally study where this leakage occurs."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06924v2",
        "abstract": "Deep learning models trained to optimize average accuracy often exhibit systematic failures on particular subpopulations. In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice."
