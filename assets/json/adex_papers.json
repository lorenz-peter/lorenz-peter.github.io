        "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware\nimperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer\ndevice identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G\nnetworks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have\nprimarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial\nvariations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of\nthese DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we\nsystematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting\nsystems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a\nconsistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where\na device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis\nbased on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can\nbe exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude\ninto the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received\nsignals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and\nsignal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be\nmitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence\nthresholds."

The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous\nglucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected\nfrom 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with\ntype 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support\nresearchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes\ndatasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with\ndata selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood\nglucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through\nthis case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction\nacross all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML\ncollection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different\nprediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets.

        "abstract": "Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under\nsubstantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely\nunexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different\nadversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and\nadversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial\ntraining strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the\nclassification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks\ndesigned to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used\nfor robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses\nthe stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.\nResults show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space\nattacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative\nand simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These\nfindings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial\ntraining holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution\nshifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a range\nof NLP tasks. However, their strong instruction-following capabilities and\ninability to distinguish instructions from data content make them vulnerable to\nindirect prompt injection attacks. In such attacks, instructions with malicious\npurposes are injected into external data sources, such as web documents. When\nLLMs retrieve this injected data through tools, such as a search engine and\nexecute the injected instructions, they provide misled responses. Recent attack\nmethods have demonstrated potential, but their abrupt instruction injection\noften undermines their effectiveness. Motivated by the limitations of existing\nattack methods, we propose TopicAttack, which prompts the LLM to generate a\nfabricated conversational transition prompt that gradually shifts the topic\ntoward the injected instruction, making the injection smoother and enhancing\nthe plausibility and success of the attack. Through comprehensive experiments,\nTopicAttack achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an attack success rate\n(ASR) over 90\\% in most cases, even when various defense methods are applied.\nWe further analyze its effectiveness by examining attention scores. We find\nthat a higher injected-to-original attention ratio leads to a greater success\nprobability, and our method achieves a much higher ratio than the baseline\nmethods."

        "abstract": "In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of\nhands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to\nthe inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions\nthat occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,\na novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI\npose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\napproaches."

        "abstract": "The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological\nsignals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient\nassessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in\nmany biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional\nmethods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class\nimbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced\ndata augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were\napplied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the\nproposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH\nArrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,\nand 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types\nand clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and\nprocesses each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on\nlow-end or wearable devices."

        "abstract": "Channel estimation is crucial in wireless communications. However, in many\npapers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one\nexample channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often\ndegrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate\ntheir training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often\nassumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and\nlimited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and\ncomputing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters.\nThis motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform\nrobustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information\nbeing known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, trained neural networks\nrequire no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world\nimplementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a\nbenchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel\nprofiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with\ndifferent levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears\nto be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural\nnetworks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed\nchannel profiles and variable delay spreads."

        "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack\nvalid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire\nsurvival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and\nTargeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,\nexisting neural implementations either rely on \"targeted losses\" that do not\nguarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally\nexpensive post-hoc \"fluctuations\" for multi-parameter settings. We propose\nTargeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly\ninto the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone\narchitecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but\na small \"targeting\" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting\ngradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the\ngradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in\nestimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid\nconfidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal\nestimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting\ngradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits\nclassical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric\nefficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment\neffects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces\nbias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators\nand prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable\npathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for\ncomplex multi-parameter targets."

        "abstract": "We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes\n(MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs\n(PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the\nnumerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead\nobserves preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices\nbeing compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the\nreward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a\nregret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we\npresent a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{HSAT})$ for\nepisodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per\nepisode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is\nthe number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret\nlower bound of $\\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda\nscores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that\nachieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global\noptimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all\noccupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3}\nT^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from\nsuboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and\ncomputational inefficiency.

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the\nimplications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected\ncoresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an\nextensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations\nbenchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,\nand five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.\nThereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between\nsample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant\nmodel robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using\nembedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk\nof inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based\non learning dynamics.

In many applications, such as smart home energy and\nenvironmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different\nlocations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.\nAccurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is\ncrucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather\nforecasting.

This makes them a promising approach for\nlearning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve\ntasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which\ndo not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate\nthe performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nRobust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that\nexplicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training.

This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient\nframework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)\nalgorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.\n  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier\nremoval techniques across multiple public datasets.\n  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly\navailable datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.\nSince these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted\ntheir segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the\nrobustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation\nand remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors\nand a contamination ratio of 5%.

        "abstract": "Backdoor attacks involve either poisoning the training data or directly\nmodifying the model in order to implant a hidden behavior, that causes the\nmodel to misclassify inputs when a specific trigger is present. During\ninference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but\nmisclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class.\nExisting research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the\nspatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make\nthem stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that\nare imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated\nthe semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed\n3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic\ndomains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as\ntriggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a\npreliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral\ndomain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back\nto the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and\nbenign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and\nhuman inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with\ntheoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight\nthe need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

However, existing unlearning\nmethods mainly focus on recovering trigger patterns but fail to restore the\ncorrect semantic labels of poison samples. This limitation prevents them from\nfully eliminating the false correlation between the trigger pattern and the\ntarget label. To address this, we leverage boundary adversarial attack\ntechniques, revealing two key observations. First, poison samples exhibit\nsignificantly greater distances from decision boundaries compared to clean\nsamples, indicating they require larger adversarial perturbations to change\ntheir predictions. Second, while adversarial predicted labels for clean samples\nare uniformly distributed, those for poison samples tend to revert to their\noriginal correct labels. Moreover, the features of poison samples restore to\nclosely resemble those of corresponding clean samples after adding adversarial\nperturbations. Building upon these insights, we propose Backdoor Unlearning via\nadversaRial bouNdary analysis (BURN), a novel defense framework that integrates\nfalse correlation decoupling, progressive data refinement, and model\npurification. In the first phase, BURN employs adversarial boundary analysis to\ndetect poisoned samples based on their abnormal adversarial boundary distances,\nthen restores their correct semantic labels for fine-tuning. In the second\nphase, it employs a feedback mechanism that tracks prediction discrepancies\nbetween the original backdoored model and progressively sanitized models,\nguiding both dataset refinement and model purification.

Existing frameworks, trained on open-source\ndatasets, struggle with complex business logic and lack domain-specific data\nfor fine-tuning.

Second, it proposes a decomposition method for complex queries using an\nautomated workflow generator. Additionally, SQLord features a comprehensive\nGPT-Judge evaluation framework, including Execution Evaluation (EXE), Query-SQL\nEvaluation (QSE), and SQL-SQL Evaluation (SSE), tailored to diverse scenarios.\nOffline tests significantly outperform state of the art baselines, and online\naccuracy consistently exceeds 90, highlighting SQLord's advantages and\neffectiveness in complex real world scenarios.

In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack\n(3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the\nfull 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly\noptimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior\nworks that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both\ngeometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color,\nopacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects.\nWe further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to\npreserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates\ncomplex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world\nconditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world\nsetups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA\nachieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\\% to 7.38\\%, significantly\noutperforming existing 3D physical attacks.

They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each\ntask, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing\nimages. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently\ntrained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under\nmisleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge\nAlignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model\nrobustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)\nDual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature\ndistributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global\nclassifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to\ndistinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.\n(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference\nscheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant\nsub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in\nmisleading task-id predictions.

By sourcing activations from \"deceptive\" prompts and\npatching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate\nvulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network\nsimulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we\ndemonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from\na 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We\npropose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation\nin multimodal settings, and scaling effects.

The\nframework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form\ngame, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while\nanticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI\nsolution, the \"Purple Agent,\" which integrates adversarial exploration and\ndefensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT).

        "abstract": "In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and\ntransformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of\nconvolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through\nconsecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and\nmemory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer\nlayers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For\ntransformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head\nattention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is\ncomputationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size\nreduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.\nNevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise\ntraining or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on\nhigher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the\nresolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by\nlearnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator\nwhich has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier\ntransform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the\nfrequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,\nfast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the\nBraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS\nshowed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model\nparameters.

While extensively studied on\nIntel and AMD CPUs with DDR and LPDDR memories, its impact on GPUs using GDDR\nmemories, critical for emerging machine learning applications, remains\nunexplored. Rowhammer attacks on GPUs face unique challenges: (1) proprietary\nmapping of physical memory to GDDR banks and rows, (2) high memory latency and\nfaster refresh rates that hinder effective hammering, and (3) proprietary\nmitigations in GDDR memories, difficult to reverse-engineer without FPGA-based\ntest platforms.

        "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) is a family of definitions that bound the\nworst-case privacy leakage of a mechanism. One important feature of the\nworst-case DP guarantee is it naturally implies protections against adversaries\nwith less prior information, more sophisticated attack goals, and complex\nmeasures of a successful attack. However, the analytical tradeoffs between the\nadversarial model and the privacy protections conferred by DP are not well\nunderstood thus far. To that end, this work sheds light on what the worst-case\nguarantee of DP implies about the success of attackers that are more\nrepresentative of real-world privacy risks.\n  In this paper, we present a single flexible framework that generalizes and\nextends the patchwork of bounds on DP mechanisms found in prior work. Our\nframework allows us to compute high-probability guarantees for DP mechanisms on\na large family of natural attack settings that previous bounds do not capture.\nOne class of such settings is the approximate reconstruction of multiple\nindividuals' data, such as inferring nearly entire columns of a tabular data\nset from noisy marginals and extracting sensitive information from DP-trained\nlanguage models.\n  We conduct two empirical case studies to illustrate the versatility of our\nbounds and compare them to the success of state-of-the-art attacks.\nSpecifically, we study attacks that extract non-uniform PII from a DP-trained\nlanguage model, as well as multi-column reconstruction attacks where the\nadversary has access to some columns in the clear and attempts to reconstruct\nthe remaining columns for each person's record. We find that the absolute\nprivacy risk of attacking non-uniform data is highly dependent on the\nadversary's prior probability of success. Our high probability bounds give us a\nnuanced understanding of the privacy leakage of DP mechanisms in a variety of\npreviously understudied attack settings."

This\nhighlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed\nuser and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one\nexisting model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a\nreal-life human model.

        "abstract": "Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial\nexamples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training\nobjective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise\nvulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well\ndistinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while\nclasses with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain\ndisproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong\nclasses do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust\nfeatures are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from\nstronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that\nadaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting\nfeature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted\nadversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further\nincorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,\nbuilding on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.\nComprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,\nincluding evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,\ndemonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both\nclean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and\npreserves overall accuracy.

This instruction-based\ncontrol mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs\nmust remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be\nunpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we\nintroduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with\nGPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial\nattacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change\nobjective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across\nfour downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures\nsimultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous\nevaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present\nCRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an\nefficient region-centric attack method.

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where\na robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a\nnut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving\nmillimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple\nrepetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce\nadditional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a\nreinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting\nmodule. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather\nthan the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real\ntransferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages\nreal-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and\nrotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential\nexecution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the\nwrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and\nreal-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high\none-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon\nrepetitive tasks."

To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning\n(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable\nconcepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness\nof existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in\nthe presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework\nexplicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike\nexisting approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall\nexploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion\nmodels by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a\nsingle semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten\nstate-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial\neffectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the\noriginal textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in\ncurrent unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions\nto ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

Although many existing adversarial attack\nmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm\nperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual\ncapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based\napproaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to\ninstability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on\ndiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable\nadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution\ntowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map\nto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated\nsamples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of\nnatural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but\nalso retrieval models.

        "abstract": "Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication\n(RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability\nunder dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from\nhigh exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which\nleverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a\npromising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD)\nactions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable\ndeployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust\nbandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble\n(an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD\nrisks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment\nstability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty.\nExperimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and\nimproves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%,\ndemonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications."

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose.

Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings.

Recently, metamorphic testing\nthat defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate\nthe robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing\nstill requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization\nof selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,\nmost studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in\ntheir evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based\napproach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and\nminimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the\ncombinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in\nthe robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We\nconducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a\nrandom search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our\nstatistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the\nMOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM\nrobustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM\nrobustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs\nacross different Text-to-Text tasks.

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's\nprediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in\nthe last layer."

Existing approaches\ntreat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying\ncausal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from\nthese interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal\nrelational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations\nthat produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and\ninterventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training\nsamples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation\nbetween this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the\nindependence conditions induced by the interventional causal model.

        "abstract": "We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for\nweakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both\ndetection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes\nthat depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D\ndata, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images\nrepresent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the\npool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust\nkeypoint extractor.\n  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the\nkeypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different\nscales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the\ndiscriminative capability of the learned descriptors.\n  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE\nsimplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust\nkeypoint extraction and description.

        "abstract": "Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising solution\nfor delivering personalized recommendations while safeguarding user privacy.\nHowever, recent studies have demonstrated their vulnerability to poisoning\nattacks. Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which\ncompromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,\nreal-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user\nsubgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we\nfurther propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and\nnon-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to\nalign the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing\nSpattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven\nrepresentative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSpattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific\nuser subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when\nonly 0.1\\% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive\noverall recommendation performance and exhibits strong resilience against\nexisting mainstream defenses."

Among various\ncases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among\nparties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature\ndrift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor\nfeature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of\nfeature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes\nprototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative\nlearning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall\nleverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to\nenhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a\nglobal perspective.
