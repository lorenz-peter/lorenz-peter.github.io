        "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for\nfine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.\nHowever, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to\noverfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust\noptimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the\ndata. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high\ncomputational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a\nrobust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the\npreference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior\nDRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,\navoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational\noverhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO\nobjective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We\nevaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public\nhealth task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves\nrobustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants."

        "abstract": "Calibration has emerged as a foundational goal in ``trustworthy machine\nlearning'', in part because of its strong decision theoretic semantics.\nIndependent of the underlying distribution, and independent of the decision\nmaker's utility function, calibration promises that amongst all policies\nmapping predictions to actions, the uniformly best policy is the one that\n``trusts the predictions'' and acts as if they were correct. But this is true\nonly of \\emph{fully calibrated} forecasts, which are tractable to guarantee\nonly for very low dimensional prediction problems. For higher dimensional\nprediction problems (e.g. when outcomes are multiclass), weaker forms of\ncalibration have been studied that lack these decision theoretic properties. In\nthis paper we study how a conservative decision maker should map predictions\nendowed with these weaker (``partial'') calibration guarantees to actions, in a\nway that is robust in a minimax sense: i.e. to maximize their expected utility\nin the worst case over distributions consistent with the calibration\nguarantees. We characterize their minimax optimal decision rule via a duality\nargument, and show that surprisingly, ``trusting the predictions and acting\naccordingly'' is recovered in this minimax sense by \\emph{decision calibration}\n(and any strictly stronger notion of calibration), a substantially weaker and\nmore tractable condition than full calibration. For calibration guarantees that\nfall short of decision calibration, the minimax optimal decision rule is still\nefficiently computable, and we provide an empirical evaluation of a natural one\nthat applies to any regression model solved to optimize squared error."

        "abstract": "Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives\nefficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by\nassigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation\nmethods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating\nchanges in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as\nopposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different\npatterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods\nbased on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when\nthe validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware\nmethods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical\ndeployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),\na plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an\nID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral\napproximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and\nOOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then\nestimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via\nperturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV\nplugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional\ntraining loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and\nstable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining\ncomputationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for\nlarge-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to\nOOD-robust data valuation."

To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient\nalgorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for\nrobustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in\nsuperseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,\nwhich inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming\ntraditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,\naugmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not\nonly improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise\nimmunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration\nand derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded\ninto a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the\npower of deep learning.

To tackle the issues,\nthis paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction\n(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,\nadaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,\nwe propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate\nthe unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language\nreferences.

        "abstract": "This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental\nframework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical\nlearning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve\ndistributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being\ndiverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it\nshould lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a\ndiffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial\ndistributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency\nwith the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose\nDiffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner\nmaximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally\nestablish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically\ndemonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance\nin a ML prediction task."

This proof-of-concept (PoC) study demonstrates the adaptation of a\nnoise-driven physically unclonable function (PUF) and machine learning\n(ML)-assisted anomaly detection framework to the demanding environment of\nWBG-based ICS sensor pathways. By extracting entropy from unavoidable WBG\nswitching noise (up to 100 kHz) as a PUF source, and simultaneously using this\nnoise as a real-time threat indicator, the proposed system unites\nhardware-level authentication and anomaly detection. Our approach integrates\nhybrid machine learning (ML) models with adaptive Bayesian filtering, providing\nrobust and low-latency detection capabilities resilient to both natural\nelectromagnetic interference (EMI) and active adversarial manipulation. Through\ndetailed simulations of WBG modules under benign and attack\nscenarios--including EMI injection, signal tampering, and node\nimpersonation--we achieve 95% detection accuracy and sub-millisecond processing\nlatency.

Furthermore, most defenses are\ndeveloped to secure deep neural networks or binary classifiers. However,\ntraditional multiclass classifiers need attention to be secure from data\npoisoning attacks, as these models are significant in developing multi-modal\napplications. Therefore, this paper proposes SecureLearn, a two-layer\nattack-agnostic defense to defend multiclass models from poisoning attacks. It\ncomprises two components of data sanitization and a new feature-oriented\nadversarial training. To ascertain the effectiveness of SecureLearn, we\nproposed a 3D evaluation matrix with three orthogonal dimensions: data\npoisoning attack, data sanitization and adversarial training. Benchmarking\nSecureLearn in a 3D matrix, a detailed analysis is conducted at different\npoisoning levels (10%-20%), particularly analysing accuracy, recall, F1-score,\ndetection and correction rates, and false discovery rate. The experimentation\nis conducted for four ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree\n(DT), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), trained with\nthree public datasets, against three poisoning attacks and compared with two\nexisting mitigations. Our results highlight that SecureLearn is effective\nagainst the provided attacks. SecureLearn has strengthened resilience and\nadversarial robustness of traditional multiclass models and neural networks,\nconfirming its generalization beyond algorithm-specific defenses. It\nconsistently maintained accuracy above 90%, recall and F1-score above 75%. For\nneural networks, SecureLearn achieved 97% recall and F1-score against all\nselected poisoning attacks."

In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks,\nwhere adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services.\nThese attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats\nto revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking\nsolution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model\ntraceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study\nthe vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\\delta$-STEAL, a\nnovel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark\ndetectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\\delta$-STEAL\ninjects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during\nfine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP)\nguarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect\noutputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise\nto these pairs, $\\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it\ndifficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used,\nthereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that\n$\\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of\nup to $96.95\\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model\nutility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack\neffectiveness and model utility.

Defending against novel jailbreaks\nrepresents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract\nand compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with\nLLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates.

AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the\nAndroid permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains\nmalicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a\ndataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access\ncontrol policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%\naccuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats\nin several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces\nnegligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers\nwith a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining\nproductivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions\nfor declarative access control and MCP security."

However, most existing watermarking algorithms rely on heuristic\ngreen/red token list designs, as directly optimizing the list design with\ntechniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) comes with several challenges.\nFirst, desirable watermarking involves multiple criteria, i.e., detectability,\ntext quality, robustness against removal attacks, and security against spoofing\nattacks.

By exploiting correlations between facial\nand vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass\nindustry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and\nMicrosoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are\nfar easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering\nthe barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core\nresearch questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors\nreliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and\n(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection\nwithout overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators\nsuch as SpeechT5.\n  Our study makes three contributions.

We show that EBR solely\nrequires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions\nto retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the\ndescription logic $\\mathcal{SHOIQ}$.

        "abstract": "Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of\nadverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular\nstructures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained\ninter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms\nsuch as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically\nrely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level\ncross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse\nmolecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement\nframework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph\nthat integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of\ninter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is\nthe potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling\nlong-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure\nconsistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the\nglobal structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively\nlearn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.\npatterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI\ntypes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge\nconsistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph\nrefinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic\ninterpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining\nand Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing\ndrug-drug interaction networks."

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each\nhigher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time\nseries. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that\nthe forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the\nforecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal\nreconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,\nhowever, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from\nfinite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance\nmatrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nrobust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for\nuncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an\nuncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a\nreconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error\nover this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a\nsemidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than\nexisting hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of\nintegrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process."

In\nthis work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating\nInternal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external\ncorrection to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's\nown reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent\nthrough a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract\ncore semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety\nawareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust\ndecision-making.

We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal\nCNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated\nWavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,\nmulti-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and\nshift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and\nmild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and\npassed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a\ngrouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head\nfor causal temporal integration.\n  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves\nrobustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and\nwhether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and\ninter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,\nRatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by\n+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /\n+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest\ncomputational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet\nfront end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,\nimproving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency."

The framework was trained on thin section\nsamples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,\nsimultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a\nsingle unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network\nprinciples and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone\nfabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures\nwith anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control\n(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.\nMorphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network\ncharacteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and\ntortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological\ntolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior\nrepresentativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to\n36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images.

The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art\nmodel-level defenses without any adaptive optimization.

        "abstract": "Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many\ndomains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as\ncode-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct\nfine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and\noverwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this\nchallenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation\nmodels, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and\nthereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply\nour approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual\ncode-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while\nsignificantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to\nLoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new\ndomain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for\nfine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization."

To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization\n(CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed\nVQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework,\nsemantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation\nconstellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities\ninto the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with\nsemantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further\nintroduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by\ndecomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized\nsubchannels.

To investigate this paradox, we\nconstruct a scenario-game dataset spanning 3 macro scenes and 19 sub-scenes,\nand run extensive closed-loop interactions with trust explicitly parameterized.\nUsing Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) as the safety baseline, we propose\ntwo unified metrics: Over-Exposure Rate (OER) to detect boundary violations,\nand Authorization Drift (AD) to capture sensitivity to trust levels. Results\nacross multiple model backends and orchestration frameworks reveal consistent\ntrends: higher trust improves task success but also heightens exposure risks,\nwith heterogeneous trust-to-risk mappings across systems. We further examine\ndefenses such as Sensitive Information Repartitioning and Guardian-Agent\nenablement, both of which reduce OER and attenuate AD.

Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry.

The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test.

To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp\nlocal minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask\nselection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome\nthis issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed\nScore-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP).

Instead of directly\napplying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea\n-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the\nframework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed\ntarget (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key\nadvantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the\nneed for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;\n(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which\nquantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward\npass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models\nsuch as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy\nbut heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as\nthe learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly\nscore inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is\nLipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical\nguarantees under small perturbations.

The strategy employs\nfour key techniques: the model cloning algorithm, input-specific perturbations,\nuniversal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), and targeted UAPs. This strategy\ntargets ML models used by both xApps and rApps within the O-RAN system, aiming\nto degrade network performance. We validate the effectiveness of the designed\nevasion attack strategy and quantify the scale of performance degradation using\na real-world O-RAN testbed and emulation environments. Evaluation is conducted\nusing the Interference Classification xApp and the Power Saving rApp as\nrepresentatives for near-RT and non-RT RICs.

        "abstract": "The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into Open Radio Access\nNetworks (O-RAN) enhances communication in disaster management and Search and\nRescue (SAR) operations by ensuring connectivity when infrastructure fails.\nHowever, SAR scenarios demand stringent security and low-latency communication,\nas delays or breaches can compromise mission success. While UAVs serve as\nmobile relays, they introduce challenges in energy consumption and resource\nmanagement, necessitating intelligent allocation strategies. Existing\nUAV-assisted O-RAN approaches often overlook the joint optimization of\nsecurity, latency, and energy efficiency in dynamic environments. This paper\nproposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic\nresource allocation in UAV relays, explicitly addressing these trade-offs. Our\napproach formulates an optimization problem that integrates security-aware\nresource allocation, latency minimization, and energy efficiency, which is\nsolved using RL.

These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in\nlinear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover\nintrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major\nlimitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,\nemphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model\nlong-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to\n4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC\n(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model\ncombining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying\ndiscriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal\nintegrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing\nparameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based\nself-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global\ndependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations.

End-to-end FR systems first obtain\npreprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the\nsimilarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a\ncritical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,\nwe observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.\nOur study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different\npreprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice\nof face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,\nwhereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively\nminimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial\npreprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the\nunintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.\nBased on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using\ninput transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks\nby up to 27%.

Examples of target properties $T$ include the\nbinary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the\ndegree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both\nelicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable\nsignal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response\ncontaining answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of\ninformation leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled\nguidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this\ngap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information\ncan be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods\ncome to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest\nincrease in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic\nin terms of the desired accuracy.

On the other hand, existing indirect methods,\nincluding near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and\nimage-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from\nvarious sources. Variability in the source material can alter data\ndistributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,\nthere is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of\nsource variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture\nfeatures have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on\nthis, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct\ntexture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture\ncontent. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five\ntexture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms\nindividual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust\nmoisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist\nthat utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of\nwood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We\nalso proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual\ninformation.

To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a\ndataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these\nprompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome\nextensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions:\nscenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories.

Predictions about demand arrive over time and become\nincreasingly accurate, while worker availability decreases. This creates a\nfundamental trade-off between hiring early to avoid understaffing (when workers\nare more available but forecasts are less reliable) and hiring late to avoid\noverstaffing (when forecasts are more accurate but availability is lower). This\nproblem is motivated by last-mile delivery operations, where companies such as\nAmazon rely on gig-economy workers whose availability declines closer to the\noperating day.\n  To address practical limitations of Bayesian models (in particular, to remain\nagnostic to the underlying forecasting method), we study this problem under\nadversarial predictions. In this model, sequential predictions are\nadversarially chosen uncertainty intervals that (approximately) contain the\ntrue demand. The objective is to minimize worst-case staffing imbalance cost.\nOur main result is a simple and computationally efficient online algorithm that\nis minimax optimal. We first characterize the minimax cost against a restricted\nadversary via a polynomial-size linear program, then show how to emulate this\nsolution in the general case. While our base model focuses on a single demand,\nwe extend the framework to multiple demands (with egalitarian/utilitarian\nobjectives), to settings with costly reversals of hiring decisions, and to\ninconsistent prediction intervals. We also introduce a practical \"re-solving\"\nvariant of our algorithm, which we prove is also minimax optimal. Finally we\nconduct numerical experiments showing that our algorithms outperform Bayesian\nheuristics in both cost and speed, and are competitive with (approximate or\nexact) Bayesian-optimal policies when those can be computed."

Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that\nutilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of\nunseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,\nwe demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can\nbe applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP\nwas developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully\ndegrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation\nmodels - never seen before.

Evaluations across four latest Intel\narchitectures demonstrate $\\rho$Hammer's breakthrough effectiveness: it induces\nup to 200K+ additional bit flips within 2-hour attack pattern fuzzing processes\nand has a 112x higher flip rate than the load-based hammering baselines on\nComet and Rocket Lake. Also, we are the first to revive Rowhammer attacks on\nthe latest Raptor Lake architecture, where baselines completely fail, achieving\nstable flip rates of 2,291/min and fast end-to-end exploitation."

First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,\nproduction typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging\nenvironments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the\nscarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass\nIndividualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first\nbenchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,\nMIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse\nindividualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected\nfrom six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial\nimaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion\nconditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nanomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and\nzero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all\nmodels compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved\ncomplexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production.

This limitation\nimpairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and\nresults in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose\nDPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by\nencoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel\nenriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,\ndrawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures\nthe object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich\nthe feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these\ntopology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core\nguidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained\nattribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on\nchannel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the\nfeatures of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and\nconvert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust\nnighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate\nDPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack."

Yet,\nvision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture\nthe complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their\nability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper\npresents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition\nframework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach\ncombines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical\nflow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV\nmotion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract\ndiscriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is\nadopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To\nenhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module\nis introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature\nscales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic\nconsistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental\nresults on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly\noutperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\\%, 96.5\\%, and 92.8\\% accuracy\non the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively."

Framed through the unifying\nperspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application\ndomains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The\nfirst part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in\nranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to\na counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not\nto underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee\nis extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial\nor misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over\npermissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where\nvarious off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction\nframework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise\nboth evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy\nlearning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency\nand effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE\nmotivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple\ndiffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped\nobjective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing\ngenerations that align more faithfully with textual attributes."

        "abstract": "Beyond its widespread application in signal and image processing,\n\\emph{compressed sensing} principles have been greatly applied to secure\ninformation transmission (often termed 'compressive security'). In this\nscenario, the measurement matrix $Q$ acts as a one time pad encryption key (in\ncomplex number domain) which can achieve perfect information-theoretic security\ntogether with other benefits such as reduced complexity and energy efficiency\nparticularly useful in IoT. However, unless the matrix is changed for every\nmessage it is vulnerable towards known plain text attacks: only $n$\nobservations suffices to recover a key $Q$ with $n$ columns. In this paper, we\ninvent and analyze a new method (termed 'Bilinear Compressive Security (BCS)')\naddressing these shortcomings: In addition to the linear encoding of the\nmessage $x$ with a matrix $Q$, the sender convolves the resulting vector with a\nrandomly generated filter $h$. Assuming that $h$ and $x$ are sparse, the\nreceiver can then recover $x$ without knowledge of $h$ from $y=h*Qx$ through\nblind deconvolution. We study a rather idealized known plaintext attack for\nrecovering $Q$ from repeated observations of $y$'s for different, known $x_k$,\nwith varying and unknown $h$ ,giving Eve a number of advantages not present in\npractice. Our main result for BCS states that under a weak symmetry condition\non the filter $h$, recovering $Q$ will require extensive sampling from\ntransmissions of $\\Omega\\left(\\max\\left(n,(n/s)^2\\right)\\right)$ messages $x_k$\nif they are $s$-sparse.

However, in\nmodern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an\noptimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward\nscale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,\ndegrading $\\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay\nscaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,\nthe singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as\n$\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width\nscaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as\n$\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}\\cdot d^{0.75}$.

Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set\naround the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes\nworst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian\nsearch. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution\nshift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the\ninstruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality\nrewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench\ninformative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to\napproximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.\nMoreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.\nMeanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating\nno loss on in-distribution cases.
