        "abstract": "Augmented reality assembly guidance is essential for intelligent\nmanufacturing and medical applications, requiring continuous measurement of the\n6DoF poses of manipulated objects. Although current tracking methods have made\nsignificant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges\nin robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric\nobjects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust\ncontour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour\ncorrespondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search\nstrategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise\nuncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust\ncontour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better\ntrack rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in\novercoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is\nachieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates\noffline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their\ncorrespondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy\nfunction to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a\nre-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real\nscenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS\nusing only a CPU."

In this position paper, we illustrate that current\nresearch on the robustness of large language models (LLMs) risks repeating past\npatterns with potentially worsened real-world implications. To address this, we\nargue that realigned objectives are necessary for meaningful progress in\nadversarial alignment. To this end, we build on established cybersecurity\ntaxonomy to formally define differences between past and emerging threat models\nthat apply to LLMs. Using this framework, we illustrate that progress requires\ndisentangling adversarial alignment into addressable sub-problems and returning\nto core academic principles, such as measureability, reproducibility, and\ncomparability. Although the field presents significant challenges, the fresh\nstart on adversarial robustness offers the unique opportunity to build on past\nexperience while avoiding previous mistakes."

However, recent studies have proven that such embeddings\nare vulnerable to inversion attacks, where original text is reconstructed to\nreveal sensitive information. Previous research has largely assumed access to\nmillions of sentences to train attack models, e.g., through data leakage or\nnearly unrestricted API access. With our method, a single data point is\nsufficient for a partially successful inversion attack. With as little as 1k\ndata samples, performance reaches an optimum across a range of black-box\nencoders, without training on leaked data. We present a Few-shot Textual\nEmbedding Inversion Attack using ALignment and GENeration (ALGEN), by aligning\nvictim embeddings to the attack space and using a generative model to\nreconstruct text. We find that ALGEN attacks can be effectively transferred\nacross domains and languages, revealing key information. We further examine a\nvariety of defense mechanisms against ALGEN, and find that none are effective,\nhighlighting the vulnerabilities posed by inversion attacks. By significantly\nlowering the cost of inversion and proving that embedding spaces can be aligned\nthrough one-step optimization, we establish a new textual embedding inversion\nparadigm with broader applications for embedding alignment in NLP."

Among these threats, backdoor attacks\nhave left a deep impression on people with their concealment and simple\ndeployment, making them a threat that cannot be ignored, however, in the\nprocess of deploying the backdoor model, the backdoor attack often has some\nreasons that make it unsatisfactory in real-world applications, such as jitter\nand brightness changes.

However, existing research often falls short in leveraging\nthese insights to assist or guide users in harnessing IoT security practices in\na clear and actionable way. In this paper, we propose ChatIoT, a large language\nmodel (LLM)-based IoT security assistant designed to disseminate IoT security\nand threat intelligence. By leveraging the versatile property of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ChatIoT successfully integrates the\nadvanced language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM with\nfast-evolving IoT security information. Moreover, we develop an end-to-end data\nprocessing toolkit to handle heterogeneous datasets. This toolkit converts\ndatasets of various formats into retrievable documents and optimizes chunking\nstrategies for efficient retrieval. Additionally, we define a set of common use\ncase specifications to guide the LLM in generating answers aligned with users'\nspecific needs and expertise levels. Finally, we implement a prototype of\nChatIoT and conduct extensive experiments with different LLMs, such as LLaMA3,\nLLaMA3.1, and GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ChatIoT can\ngenerate more reliable, relevant, and technical in-depth answers for most use\ncases. When evaluating the answers with LLaMA3:70B, ChatIoT improves the above\nmetrics by over 10% on average, particularly in relevance and technicality,\ncompared to using LLMs alone."

        "abstract": "Machine learning models can inadvertently expose confidential properties of\ntheir training data, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks\n(MIA). While numerous evaluation methods exist, many require computationally\nexpensive processes, such as training multiple shadow models. This article\npresents two new complementary approaches for efficiently identifying\nvulnerable tree-based models: an ante-hoc analysis of hyperparameter choices\nand a post-hoc examination of trained model structure. While these new methods\ncannot certify whether a model is safe from MIA, they provide practitioners\nwith a means to significantly reduce the number of models that need to undergo\nexpensive MIA assessment through a hierarchical filtering approach.\n  More specifically, it is shown that the rank order of disclosure risk for\ndifferent hyperparameter combinations remains consistent across datasets,\nenabling the development of simple, human-interpretable rules for identifying\nrelatively high-risk models before training. While this ante-hoc analysis\ncannot determine absolute safety since this also depends on the specific\ndataset, it allows the elimination of unnecessarily risky configurations during\nhyperparameter tuning. Additionally, computationally inexpensive structural\nmetrics serve as indicators of MIA vulnerability, providing a second filtering\nstage to identify risky models after training but before conducting expensive\nattacks. Empirical results show that hyperparameter-based risk prediction rules\ncan achieve high accuracy in predicting the most at risk combinations of\nhyperparameters across different tree-based model types, while requiring no\nmodel training. Moreover, target model accuracy is not seen to correlate with\nprivacy risk, suggesting opportunities to optimise model configurations for\nboth performance and privacy."

The classic internal model control (IMC) principle demonstrates\nthat a closed-loop system with an internal model that includes external input\nsignals can accurately track the reference input and effectively offset the\ndisturbance. We propose a novel closed-loop VLA method GEVRM that integrates\nthe IMC principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The\ntext-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive\nfuture visual planning goals. Simultaneously, we evaluate perturbations by\nsimulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized\nthrough prototype contrastive learning.

        "abstract": "Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated their\nability to understand and employ deceptive behavior, even without explicit\nprompting. However, such behavior has only been observed in rare, specialized\ncases and has not been shown to pose a serious risk to users. Additionally,\nresearch on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models\nto refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally\nbecame honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce a novel attack that\nundermines both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if exploited,\ncould have serious real-world consequences. In particular, we introduce\nfine-tuning methods that enhance deception tendencies beyond model safeguards.\nThese \"deception attacks\" customize models to mislead users when prompted on\nchosen topics while remaining accurate on others. Furthermore, we find that\ndeceptive models also exhibit toxicity, generating hate speech, stereotypes,\nand other harmful content. Finally, we assess whether models can deceive\nconsistently in multi-turn dialogues, yielding mixed results. Given that\nmillions of users interact with LLM-based chatbots, voice assistants, agents,\nand other interfaces where trustworthiness cannot be ensured, securing these\nmodels against deception attacks is critical."

However, temporal\nasynchrony in real-world environments, caused by communication delays, clock\nmisalignment, or sampling configuration differences, can lead to information\nmismatches. If this is not well handled, then the collaborative performance is\npatchy, and what's worse safety accidents may occur. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose CoDynTrust, an uncertainty-encoded asynchronous fusion perception\nframework that is robust to the information mismatches caused by temporal\nasynchrony. CoDynTrust generates dynamic feature trust modulus (DFTM) for each\nregion of interest by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as\nselectively suppressing or retaining single-vehicle features, thereby\nmitigating information mismatches. We then design a multi-scale fusion module\nto handle multi-scale feature maps processed by DFTM. Compared to existing\nworks that also consider asynchronous collaborative perception, CoDynTrust\ncombats various low-quality information in temporally asynchronous scenarios\nand allows uncertainty to be propagated to downstream tasks such as planning\nand control. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDynTrust significantly\nreduces performance degradation caused by temporal asynchrony across multiple\ndatasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with temporal\nasynchrony.

Local differential privacy\n(LDP) is regarded as an effective defense against various attacks, including\nsample reconstruction in FL, where gradients are clipped and perturbed.\nExisting attacks are ineffective in FL with LDP since clipped and perturbed\ngradients obliterate most sample information for reconstruction. Besides,\nexisting attacks embed additional sample information into gradients to improve\nthe attack effect and cause gradient expansion, leading to a more severe\ngradient clipping in FL with LDP. In this paper, we propose a sample\nreconstruction attack against LDP-based FL with any target models to\nreconstruct victims' sensitive samples to illustrate that FL with LDP is not\nflawless. Considering gradient expansion in reconstruction attacks and noise in\nLDP, the core of the proposed attack is gradient compression and reconstructed\nsample denoising. For gradient compression, an inference structure based on\nsample characteristics is presented to reduce redundant gradients against LDP.\nFor reconstructed sample denoising, we artificially introduce zero gradients to\nobserve noise distribution and scale confidence interval to filter the noise.\nTheoretical proof guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed attack.\nEvaluations show that the proposed attack is the only attack that reconstructs\nvictims' training samples in LDP-based FL and has little impact on the target\nmodel's accuracy.

In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based\non the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural\nnetworks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden\nrepresentations. We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts\nas toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that\nmanipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts. Through\nconcept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic\nconcepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts. However, unlike harmful\nprompts, jailbreak prompts activate the jailbreak concepts and alter the LLM\noutput from rejection to compliance. Building on our analysis, we propose a\ncomprehensive jailbreak defense framework, JBShield, consisting of two key\ncomponents: jailbreak detection JBShield-D and mitigation JBShield-M.\nJBShield-D identifies jailbreak prompts by determining whether the input\nactivates both toxic and jailbreak concepts.

For example, the\nstate-of-the-art byte-level model MalConv sees its accuracy drop from over 90%\nto below 2% under PGD (projected gradient descent) attacks. Existing\ngradient-based adversarial training techniques for malware detection or image\nprocessing were applied to malware attribution in this study, revealing that\nboth robustness and training efficiency require significant improvement. To\naddress this, we propose RoMA, a novel single-step adversarial training\napproach that integrates global perturbations to generate enhanced adversarial\nsamples and employs adversarial consistency regularization to improve\nrepresentation quality and resilience. A novel APT malware dataset named AMG18,\nwith diverse samples and realistic class imbalances, is introduced for\nevaluation. Extensive experiments show that RoMA significantly outperforms\nseven competing methods in both adversarial robustness (e.g., achieving over\n80% robust accuracy-more than twice that of the next-best method under PGD\nattacks) and training efficiency (e.g., more than twice as fast as the\nsecond-best method in terms of accuracy), while maintaining superior standard\naccuracy in non-adversarial scenarios."

In this paper, we analyze three\ntypes of mining power destruction attacks in the presence of petty-compliant\nmining pools: selfish mining, bribery, and mining power distraction attacks.

In this work, we propose two novel\ntechniques to enhance generalization: dynamic color image normalization (DCIN)\nmodule and color-quality generalization (CQG) loss. The DCIN dynamically\nnormalizes the color of test images using two reference image selection\nstrategies. Specifically, the DCIN utilizes a global reference image selection\n(GRIS), which finds a universal reference image, and a local reference image\nselection (LRIS), which selects a semantically similar reference image per test\nsample. Additionally, CQG loss enforces invariance to color and quality\nvariations by ensuring consistent segmentation predictions across transformed\nimage pairs. Experimental results show that our proposals significantly improve\nsegmentation performance over the baseline on two target domain datasets,\ndespite being trained solely on a single source domain. Notably, our model\nachieved up to a 32.3-point increase in Dice score compared to the baseline,\nconsistently producing robust and usable results even under substantial domain\nshifts.

Still, the reward mechanism available in\ndecentralized systems, motivates the adversary to act rationally. While the\ndecoder, as the data collector (DC), has an acceptance and rejection mechanism,\nfollowed by an estimation module, the adversary aims to maximize its utility,\nas an increasing function of (1) the chance of acceptance (to increase the\nreward), and (2) estimation error. On the other hand, the decoder also adjusts\nits acceptance rule to maximize its own utility, as (1) an increasing function\nof the chance of acceptance (to keep the system functional), (2) decreasing\nfunction of the estimation error. Prior works within this framework rely on the\nassumption that the game is complete, that is, both the DC and the adversary\nare fully aware of each other's utility functions.

To address this\nlimitation, we develop an algorithm enabling the DC to commit to a strategy\nthat achieves within the vicinity of the equilibrium, without knowledge of the\nadversary's utility function. Our approach builds on an observation that at the\nequilibrium, the relationship between the probability of acceptance and the\nmean squared error (MSE) follows a predetermined curve independent of the\nspecific utility functions of the players.

This manual process is tedious\nand error-prone.\n  We propose a tool called Sailor that leverages machine-readable ISA\nspecifications written in Sail to automate this task. Sailor determines the\nISA-state necessary to swap during the context switch using the data collected\nfrom Sail and a novel algorithm to classify ISA-state as security-sensitive.\nUsing Sailor's output, we identify three different classes of mishandled\nISA-state across four open-source confidential computing systems. We further\nreveal five distinct security vulnerabilities that can be exploited using the\nmishandled ISA-state. This research exposes an often overlooked attack surface\nthat stems from mishandled ISA-state, enabling unprivileged adversaries to\nexploit system vulnerabilities."

In image\nclassification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily\ndepend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more\nsuitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,\nquery-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object\ndetection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box\nattack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement\nLearning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget\nprocesses. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging\nrewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR\neffectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while\nadhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed\nattack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the\nconfidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the\nImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed\nstate-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the\nMSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction\nto state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query.

Although there have been developments in this\nfield, previous research has mainly focused on integrating object detection\nwith either anonymization or federated learning. However, these pairs often\nfail to address complex privacy concerns. On the one hand, object detection\nwith anonymization alone can be vulnerable to reverse techniques. On the other\nhand, federated learning may not provide sufficient privacy guarantees.\nTherefore, we propose a new approach that combines object detection, federated\nlearning and anonymization. Combining these three components aims to offer a\nrobust privacy protection strategy by addressing different vulnerabilities in\nvisual data. Our solution is evaluated against traditional centralized models,\nshowing that while there is a slight trade-off in accuracy, the privacy\nbenefits are substantial, making it well-suited for privacy sensitive\napplications."

However, real-world multi-party settings often violate this\nassumption, as non-speakers frequently lack acoustic and textual inputs,\nleading to a significant degradation in model performance. Existing approaches\nalso tend to unify heterogeneous modalities into a single representation,\noverlooking each modality's unique characteristics. To address these\nchallenges, we propose RAMer (Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for\nEmotion Recognition), which leverages adversarial learning to refine\nmulti-modal representations by exploring both modality commonality and\nspecificity through reconstructed features enhanced by contrastive learning.\nRAMer also introduces a personality auxiliary task to complement missing\nmodalities using modality-level attention, improving emotion reasoning. To\nfurther strengthen the model's ability to capture label and modality\ninterdependency, we propose a stack shuffle strategy to enrich correlations\nbetween labels and modality-specific features.

        "abstract": "Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling\ngraph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a\ngreat challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to\ndetect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD\nnode-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in\npractice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data\nsynthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable\nDiffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data,\nas well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available\nfor graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD\ndetection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD\nexposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process\nemploys a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent\ngenerative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from\nan evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately\nclassify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID\nembeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach\nimplicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances\nrelative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios\nwithout auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on\nfive benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD\nwithout using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and\nnon-exposure baselines."

To tackle these challenges, researchers have separately\ndevised secure aggregation mechanisms to protect data privacy and robust\naggregation methods that withstand poisoning attacks. However, simultaneously\naddressing both concerns is challenging; secure aggregation facilitates\npoisoning attacks as most anomaly detection techniques require access to\nunencrypted local model updates, which are obscured by secure aggregation. Few\nrecent efforts to simultaneously tackle both challenges offen depend on\nimpractical assumption of non-colluding two-server setups that disrupt FL's\ntopology, or three-party computation which introduces scalability issues,\ncomplicating deployment and application. To overcome this dilemma, this paper\nintroduce a Dual Defense Federated learning (DDFed) framework.

DDFed initially leverages cutting-edge fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE) to securely aggregate model updates, without the impractical requirement\nfor non-colluding two-server setups and ensures strong privacy protection.\nAdditionally, we proposes a unique two-phase anomaly detection mechanism for\nencrypted model updates, featuring secure similarity computation and\nfeedback-driven collaborative selection, with additional measures to prevent\npotential privacy breaches from Byzantine clients incorporated into the\ndetection process.

This is the first work that compares the security challenges of\ntraditional sensor-involved computing systems and emerging ISC systems.\nFurthermore, new attack scenarios are predicted for board-, chip-, and\ndevice-level ISC systems. Two proof-of-concept demos are provided to inspire\nnew countermeasure designs against unique hardware security threats in ISC\nsystems."

Machine\nlearning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are\ntypically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which\nraises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining\npopularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data.\nHowever, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions.\nWhile adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain\nlargely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain.\nMoreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly\nunknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in\nenergy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models,\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in\nan FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method\n(FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data.\nThe results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks,\nattributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10%\neven with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks\nthan centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL."

However, existing works rely on priors about clean graphs or attacking\nstrategies, which are often heuristic and inconsistent. To achieve robust graph\nlearning over different types of evasion attacks and diverse datasets, we\ninvestigate this problem from a prior-free structure purification perspective.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Structure Purification\nframework named DiffSP, which creatively incorporates the graph diffusion model\nto learn intrinsic distributions of clean graphs and purify the perturbed\nstructures by removing adversaries under the direction of the captured\npredictive patterns without relying on priors. DiffSP is divided into the\nforward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process, during which\nstructure purification is achieved. To avoid valuable information loss during\nthe forward process, we propose an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion mechanism\nto selectively inject noise anisotropically. To promote semantic alignment\nbetween the clean graph and the purified graph generated during the reverse\nprocess, we reduce the generation uncertainty by the proposed graph transfer\nentropy guided denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior robustness of DiffSP against evasion attacks."

In outlier\ndetection, this calibration relies on a reference set of labeled inlier data to\ncontrol the type-I error rate. However, obtaining a perfectly labeled inlier\nreference set is often unrealistic, and a more practical scenario involves\naccess to a contaminated reference set containing a small fraction of outliers.\nThis paper analyzes the impact of such contamination on the validity of\nconformal methods. We prove that under realistic, non-adversarial settings,\ncalibration on contaminated data yields conservative type-I error control,\nshedding light on the inherent robustness of conformal methods.

The $\\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible\nsimilarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the\ninfluence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of\nthe dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This\ninfluence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all\nsequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the\ndirection of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a\nsequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model\nrelies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely,\nwhen the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is\nconsidered informative, and the $\\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new\ninput than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics.\nThe $\\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking\nand Alternator loss minimization.

        "abstract": "In October 2023, 23andMe, a prominent provider of personal genetic testing,\nancestry, and health information services, suffered a significant data breach\norchestrated by a cybercriminal known as ``Golem.'' Initially, approximately\n14,000 user accounts were compromised by a credential smear attack, exploiting\nreused usernames and passwords from previous data leaks. However, due to the\ninterconnected nature of 23andMe's DNA Relatives and Family Tree features, the\nbreach expanded exponentially, exposing sensitive personal and genetic data of\napproximately 5.5 million users and 1.4 million additional profiles. The attack\nhighlights the increasing threat of credential stuffing, exacerbated by poor\npassword hygiene and the absence of robust security measures such as\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA) and rate limiting. In response, 23andMe\nmandated password resets, implemented email-based two-step verification, and\nadvised users to update passwords across other services. This paper critically\nanalyzes the attack methodology, its impact on users and the company, and\nexplores potential mitigation strategies, including enhanced authentication\nprotocols, proactive breach detection, and improved cybersecurity practices.\nThe findings underscore the necessity of stronger user authentication measures\nand corporate responsibility in safeguarding sensitive genetic and personal\ndata."

        "abstract": "Robust training methods typically defend against specific attack types, such\nas Lp attacks with fixed budgets, and rarely account for the fact that\ndefenders may encounter new attacks over time. A natural solution is to adapt\nthe defended model to new adversaries as they arise via fine-tuning, a method\nwhich we call continual robust training (CRT). However, when implemented\nnaively, fine-tuning on new attacks degrades robustness on previous attacks.\nThis raises the question: how can we improve the initial training and\nfine-tuning of the model to simultaneously achieve robustness against previous\nand new attacks? We present theoretical results which show that the gap in a\nmodel's robustness against different attacks is bounded by how far each attack\nperturbs a sample in the model's logit space, suggesting that regularizing with\nrespect to this logit space distance can help maintain robustness against\nprevious attacks. Extensive experiments on 3 datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNette) and over 100 attack combinations demonstrate that the proposed\nregularization improves robust accuracy with little overhead in training time.\nOur findings and open-source code lay the groundwork for the deployment of\nmodels robust to evolving attacks."

To counter such threats, the Saflo scheduler employs multipath\ncommunication combined with additional security-related tasks. Specifically, it\nutilizes eBPF tools to operate in both kernel and user spaces. In the kernel\nspace, the eBPF scheduler performs multipath scheduling while excluding paths\ndisabled by the user-space programs. The user-space programs conduct\nsecurity-related computations and machine learning-based attack detection,\ndetermining whether each path should be enabled or disabled. This approach\noffloads computationally intensive tasks to user-space programs, enabling\ntimely multipath scheduling in kernel space. The Saflo scheduler was evaluated\nin a private LTE/5G testbed.

        "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful\nbehaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate\nattacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e.,\ntraining LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to\nbehave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays\na critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on\nadversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a\njailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\\Theta(M)$, it is enough\nto align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context\nlearning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust\ngeneralization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{M_{\\text{test}}}/M_{\\text{train}})$, where $M_{\\text{train}}$ and\n$M_{\\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples\nduring training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source\nLLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different\nadversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the\nattack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix\nduring jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is\npractical to defend \"long-length\" jailbreak attacks via efficient\n\"short-length\" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl."

However, malicious servers could deliberately\nmanipulate the models to reconstruct clients' data from shared gradients,\nposing significant privacy risks. Although such active gradient leakage attacks\n(AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from several limitations\nincluding incomplete attack coverage and poor stealthiness. In this paper, we\naddress these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a\nnew theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor\npoisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is\nto bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset\nof samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the\nabove limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient\nGlobal Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack\ncoverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a\ngradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient\nvulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data\nleakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage\nand surpasses SOTA with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality\n(PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR)."

To overcome this, we propose Prioritized\nRefinement for Skill-Based Meta-RL (PRISM), a robust framework that integrates\nexploration near noisy data to generate online trajectories and combines them\nwith offline data. Through prioritization, PRISM extracts high-quality data to\nlearn task-relevant skills effectively. By addressing the impact of noise, our\nmethod ensures stable skill learning and achieves superior performance in\nlong-horizon tasks, even with noisy and sub-optimal data."

        "abstract": "Semantic communication systems, which leverage Generative AI (GAI) to\ntransmit semantic meaning rather than raw data, are poised to revolutionize\nmodern communications. However, they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a type\nof poisoning manipulation that embeds malicious triggers into training\ndatasets. As a result, Backdoor attacks mislead the inference for poisoned\nsamples while clean samples remain unaffected. The existing defenses may alter\nthe model structure (such as neuron pruning that potentially degrades inference\nperformance on clean inputs, or impose strict requirements on data formats\n(such as ``Semantic Shield\" that requires image-text pairs). To address these\nlimitations, this work proposes a defense mechanism that leverages semantic\nsimilarity to detect backdoor attacks without modifying the model structure or\nimposing data format constraints. By analyzing deviations in semantic feature\nspace and establishing a threshold-based detection framework, the proposed\napproach effectively identifies poisoned samples. The experimental results\ndemonstrate high detection accuracy and recall across varying poisoning ratios,\nunderlining the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03718v1",
        "abstract": "Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an\nextensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on\nreactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened,\ne.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot\nmitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of\nattackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack\nstage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner,\nwe can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in\nthis work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers.\nSpecifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price\nmanipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it\nconducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and\ntransaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow\ndependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For\nscalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts\ninter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint\nattacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation\nresults illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines\nwith 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616\nattack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \\$9.25M financial losses, with\nonly 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector\nin Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after\nthe corresponding deployment on average. These attacks have already led to\n$641K financial losses, and seven of them are still waiting for their ripe\ntime."

We\ndemonstrate MultiQ&A's ability to crowdsource question perturbations and their\nrespective answers through independent LLM agents at scale. Our experiments\nculminated in the examination of 1.9 million question perturbations and 2.3\nmillion answers. Furthermore, MultiQ&A shows that ensembled LLMs, such as\ngpt-3.5-turbo, remain relatively robust and consistent under perturbations.\nMultiQ&A provides clarity in the response generation space, offering an\neffective method for inspecting disagreements and variability. Therefore, our\nsystem offers a potential framework for institutional LLM adoption with the\nability to measure confidence, consistency, and the quantification of\nhallucinations."

        "abstract": "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms have shown promising results in\nrobotic manipulation tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks\nremains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive study of adversarial\nattacks on both classic and recently proposed algorithms, including Behavior\nCloning (BC), LSTM-GMM, Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), Diffusion Policy (DP),\nand VQ-Behavior Transformer (VQ-BET). We study the vulnerability of these\nmethods to untargeted, targeted and universal adversarial perturbations. While\nexplicit policies, such as BC, LSTM-GMM and VQ-BET can be attacked in the same\nmanner as standard computer vision models, we find that attacks for implicit\nand denoising policy models are nuanced and require developing novel attack\nmethods. Our experiments on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks reveal\nthat most of the current methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations. We also show that these attacks are transferable across\nalgorithms, architectures, and tasks, raising concerning security\nvulnerabilities with potentially a white-box threat model. In addition, we test\nthe efficacy of a randomized smoothing, a widely used adversarial defense\ntechnique, and highlight its limitation in defending against attacks on complex\nand multi-modal action distribution common in complex control tasks. In\nsummary, our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of modern BC algorithms,\npaving way for future work in addressing such limitations."

        "abstract": "Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) has introduced a new paradigm for\nend-to-end document understanding, and quickly became one of the standard\nbenchmarks for multimodal LLMs. Automating document processing workflows,\ndriven by DocVQA models, presents significant potential for many business\nsectors. However, documents tend to contain highly sensitive information,\nraising concerns about privacy risks associated with training such DocVQA\nmodels. One significant privacy vulnerability, exploited by the membership\ninference attack, is the possibility for an adversary to determine if a\nparticular record was part of the model's training data. In this paper, we\nintroduce two novel membership inference attacks tailored specifically to\nDocVQA models. These attacks are designed for two different adversarial\nscenarios: a white-box setting, where the attacker has full access to the model\narchitecture and parameters, and a black-box setting, where only the model's\noutputs are available. Notably, our attacks assume the adversary lacks access\nto auxiliary datasets, which is more realistic in practice but also more\nchallenging. Our unsupervised methods outperform existing state-of-the-art\nmembership inference attacks across a variety of DocVQA models and datasets,\ndemonstrating their effectiveness and highlighting the privacy risks in this\ndomain."

        "abstract": "Face parsing is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling applications\nsuch as identity verification, facial editing, and controllable image\nsynthesis. However, existing face parsing models often lack fairness and\nrobustness, leading to biased segmentation across demographic groups and errors\nunder occlusions, noise, and domain shifts. These limitations affect downstream\nface synthesis, where segmentation biases can degrade generative model outputs.\nWe propose a multi-objective learning framework that optimizes accuracy,\nfairness, and robustness in face parsing. Our approach introduces a\nhomotopy-based loss function that dynamically adjusts the importance of these\nobjectives during training. To evaluate its impact, we compare multi-objective\nand single-objective U-Net models in a GAN-based face synthesis pipeline\n(Pix2PixHD). Our results show that fairness-aware and robust segmentation\nimproves photorealism and consistency in face generation. Additionally, we\nconduct preliminary experiments using ControlNet, a structured conditioning\nmodel for diffusion-based synthesis, to explore how segmentation quality\ninfluences guided image generation. Our findings demonstrate that\nmulti-objective face parsing improves demographic consistency and robustness,\nleading to higher-quality GAN-based synthesis."

Unlike conventional cyberattacks, IPI\nperpetrators leverage close proximity and personal knowledge to circumvent\nstandard protections, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. While\nsecurity clinics and other human-centered approaches effectively tailor\nsolutions for survivors, their scalability remains constrained by resource\nlimitations and the need for specialized counseling. In this paper, we present\nAID, an Automated IPI Detection system that continuously monitors for\nunauthorized access and suspicious behaviors on smartphones. AID employs a\ntwo-stage architecture to process multimodal signals stealthily and preserve\nuser privacy. A brief calibration phase upon installation enables AID to adapt\nto each user's behavioral patterns, achieving high accuracy with minimal false\nalarms. Our 27-participant user study demonstrates that AID achieves highly\naccurate detection of non-owner access and fine-grained IPI-related activities,\nattaining an end-to-end top-3 F1 score of 0.981 with a false positive rate of\n4%.

Current\njailbreaking methods rely heavily on carefully designed system prompts and\nnumerous queries to achieve a single successful attack, which is costly and\nimpractical for large-scale red-teaming. To address this challenge, we propose\nto distill the knowledge of an ensemble of SOTA attackers into a single\nopen-source model, called Knowledge-Distilled Attacker (KDA), which is\nfinetuned to automatically generate coherent and diverse attack prompts without\nthe need for meticulous system prompt engineering. Compared to existing\nattackers, KDA achieves higher attack success rates and greater cost-time\nefficiency when targeting multiple SOTA open-source and commercial black-box\nLLMs. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative diversity analysis of prompts\ngenerated by baseline methods and KDA, identifying diverse and ensemble attacks\nas key factors behind KDA's effectiveness and efficiency."
