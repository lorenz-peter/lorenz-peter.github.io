        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial\nattacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness."

        "abstract": "Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within\nconstrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require\nphysical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for\nFL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\\mathtt{OBA}$), which\nuses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our\napproach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.\nTo improve the stealthiness of $\\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\\mathtt{SoDa}$,\nwhich regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models\nduring local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to\nevade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively\ncircumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the\nmain task.\n  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce\n$\\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against\n$\\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data\ncauses significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization\nlayers. This allows $\\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and\nexclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.\nExtensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of\n$\\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\\mathtt{SoDa}$.

However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal\nmisalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes\ncontaining multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets\nare frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature\nAlignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a\nhierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),\nKnowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the\nfirst stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),\nwhich facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and\ntextual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and\nefficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of\nlinguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature\nalignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies\nmultimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct\na unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range\ncross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.\nFinally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided\nSemantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation\nintroduced in earlier stages."

        "abstract": "Synthetic data generation plays an important role in enabling data sharing,\nparticularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST\n2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box\nMulti-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%).

However,\nits robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this\npaper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor\nattacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data\nheterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the\nfirst backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL\nintegrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization\nmechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of\nglobal prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing\ntheir local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of\ntrigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns\na unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the\nprototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global\nprototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets\nand PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\\%-75\\% improvement in\nattack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving\nmain task accuracy.

        "abstract": "Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition\nsystems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world\nphysically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial\nrobustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair\nrobustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than\nfrom others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial\nrobustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has\nfocused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight\nis that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as\nface recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,\nleading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable\nbecause class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.\nAdditionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces\nsymmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions\nwhere group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to\nencourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively\nevaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including\nagainst targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR\nsignificantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across\nruns. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover\nin this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be\nclassified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry."

We summarize the causes of this\nproblem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The\ndivergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and\nrobust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and\n2.

        "abstract": "Website Fingerprinting (WFP) uses deep learning models to classify encrypted\nnetwork traffic to infer visited websites. While historically effective, prior\nmethods fail to generalize to modern web environments. Single-page applications\n(SPAs) eliminate the paradigm of websites as sets of discrete pages,\nundermining page-based classification, and traffic from scripted browsers lacks\nthe behavioral richness seen in real user sessions. Our study reveals that\nusers exhibit highly diverse behaviors even on the same website, producing\ntraffic patterns that vary significantly across individuals. This behavioral\nentropy makes WFP a harder problem than previously assumed and highlights the\nneed for larger, more diverse, and representative datasets to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, we propose a new paradigm: we drop\nsession-boundaries in favor of contiguous traffic segments and develop a\nscalable data generation pipeline using large language models (LLM) agents.\nThese multi-agent systems coordinate decision-making and browser interaction to\nsimulate realistic, persona-driven browsing behavior at 3--5x lower cost than\nhuman collection. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art WFP models on traffic from\n20 modern websites browsed by 30 real users, and compare training performance\nacross human, scripted, and LLM-generated datasets. All models achieve under\n10\\% accuracy when trained on scripted traffic and tested on human data. In\ncontrast, LLM-generated traffic boosts accuracy into the 80\\% range,\ndemonstrating strong generalization to real-world traces. Our findings indicate\nthat for modern WFP, model performance is increasingly bottlenecked by data\nquality, and that scalable, semantically grounded synthetic traffic is\nessential for capturing the complexity of real user behavior."

RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as\nunbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak\ngeneralization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive\nSemantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level\nmasks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the\nnetwork to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various\ndegradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning\nstrategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the\nintegrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while\nretaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy\nthat leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant\nrepresentations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful\nand semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves\nrobust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,\nextreme, and mixed degradations.

The TALSC\nframework incorporates a sample confidence module (SCM) as meta-learner and the\nsemantic coding networks as learners.

Meanwhile,\nthe meta-learner evaluates the significance of samples according to the task\nloss feedback, and adjusts the update strategy of learners to enhance the\nrobustness in semantic recovery for unknown tasks. To strike a balance between\nSCM parameters and precision of significance evaluation, we design an SCM-grid\nextension (SCM-GE) approach by embedding the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN)\nwithin SCM, which leverages the concept of spline refinement in KAN and enables\nscalable SCM with customizable granularity without retraining.

        "abstract": "In recent years, sequence features such as packet length have received\nconsiderable attention due to their central role in encrypted traffic analysis.\nExisting sequence modeling approaches can be broadly categorized into\nflow-level and trace-level methods: the former suffer from high feature\nredundancy, limiting their discriminative power, whereas the latter preserve\ncomplete information but incur substantial computational and storage overhead.\nTo address these limitations, we propose the \\textbf{U}p-\\textbf{D}own\n\\textbf{F}low \\textbf{S}equence (\\textbf{UDFS}) representation, which\ncompresses an entire trace into a two-dimensional sequence and characterizes\neach flow by the aggregate of its upstream and downstream traffic, reducing\ncomplexity while maintaining high discriminability. Furthermore, to address the\nchallenge of class-specific discriminability differences, we propose an\nadaptive threshold mechanism that dynamically adjusts training weights and\nrejection boundaries, enhancing the model's classification performance.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior\nclassification performance and robustness on both coarse-grained and\nfine-grained datasets, as well as under concept drift and open-world scenarios.\nCode and Dataset are available at https://github.com/kid1999/UDFS."

With the aid of SEPG, our study distills seven key findings that\nhighlight the feasibility challenges of sensor attacks and uncovers eleven\npreviously overlooked attack vectors exploiting inter-module interactions,\nseveral of which we validate through proof-of-concept experiments.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can automate\naspects of SEPG construction and cross-validate expert analysis, showcasing the\npromise of AI-assisted security evaluation."

In this\npaper, we show that it is possible to cause a failure in the Tor directory\nprotocol by targeting a majority of the authorities for only five minutes using\na well-executed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. We demonstrate\nthis attack in a controlled environment and show that it is cost-effective for\nas little as \\$53.28 per month to disrupt the protocol and to effectively bring\ndown the entire Tor network.

        "abstract": "Smart contracts automate the management of high-value assets, where\nvulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic financial losses. This challenge is\namplified in Large Language Models (LLMs) by two interconnected failures: they\noperate as unauditable \"black boxes\" lacking a transparent reasoning process,\nand consequently, generate code riddled with critical security vulnerabilities.\nTo address both issues, we propose SmartCoder-R1 (based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B), a\nnovel framework for secure and explainable smart contract generation. It begins\nwith Continual Pre-training (CPT) to specialize the model. We then apply Long\nChain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) on 7,998 expert-validated\nreasoning-and-code samples to train the model to emulate human security\nanalysis. Finally, to directly mitigate vulnerabilities, we employ\nSecurity-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a reinforcement\nlearning phase that refines the generation policy by optimizing a weighted\nreward signal for compilation success, security compliance, and format\ncorrectness. Evaluated against 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 real-world\nfunctions, SmartCoder-R1 establishes a new state of the art, achieving top\nperformance across five key metrics: a ComPass of 87.70%, a VulRate of 8.60%, a\nSafeAval of 80.16%, a FuncRate of 53.84%, and a FullRate of 50.53%. This\nFullRate marks a 45.79% relative improvement over the strongest baseline,\nDeepSeek-R1. Crucially, its generated reasoning also excels in human\nevaluations, achieving high-quality ratings for Functionality (82.7%), Security\n(85.3%), and Clarity (90.7%)."

Our\ncorresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which\nare encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our\nattentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these\nlocal depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying\nreliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In\naddition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for\nlearning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse\nconditions.

However, the\ndistributed nature enables malicious clients to manipulate the training\nprocess. By sending poisoned intermediate gradients, they can inject backdoors\ninto the shared DNN. Existing defenses are limited by often focusing on\nserver-side protection and introducing additional overhead for the server. A\nsignificant challenge for client-side defenses is enforcing malicious clients\nto correctly execute the defense algorithm.\n  We present ZORRO, a private, verifiable, and robust SL defense scheme.\nThrough our novel design and application of interactive zero-knowledge proofs\n(ZKPs), clients prove their correct execution of a client-located defense\nalgorithm, resulting in proofs of computational integrity attesting to the\nbenign nature of locally trained DNN portions.

Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For\nbinary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are\nmodified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is\n$(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.\n  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet\nthe bound up to a constant slack.

        "abstract": "5G marks a major departure from previous cellular architectures, by\ntransitioning from a monolithic design of the core network to a Service-Based\nArchitecture (SBA) where services are modularized as Network Functions (NFs)\nwhich communicate with each other via standard-defined HTTP-based APIs called\nService-Based Interfaces (SBIs). These NFs are deployed in private and public\ncloud infrastructure, and an access control framework based on OAuth restricts\nhow they communicate with each other and obtain access to resources. Given the\nincreased vulnerabilities of clouds to insiders, it is important to study the\nsecurity of the 5G Core services for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to\nuse compromised NFs to obtain unauthorized access to resources.\n  We present FivGeeFuzz, a grammar-based fuzzing framework designed to uncover\nsecurity flaws in 5G core SBIs. FivGeeFuzz automatically derives grammars from\n3GPP API specifications to generate malformed, unexpected, or semantically\ninconsistent inputs, and it integrates automated bug detection with manual\nvalidation and root-cause analysis. We evaluate our approach on free5GC, the\nonly open-source 5G core implementing Release 17-compliant SBIs with an access\ncontrol mechanism. Using FivGeeFuzz, we discovered 8 previously unknown\nvulnerabilities in free5GC, leading to runtime crashes, improper error\nhandling, and unauthorized access to resources, including a very severe attack\nwe call Cross-Service Token Attack. All bugs were confirmed by the free5GC\nteam, 7 have already been patched, and the remaining one has a patch under\ndevelopment."

It\ncan only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer.\nQuantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder\nto output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far\nmore errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain:\nwhich quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes\nthat are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this\nwork, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a\ngeneralized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Then, using tools from\nquantum cryptography, we build an unambiguous list decoding protocol based on\npseudorandom unitaries. Our scheme is secure against any quantum\npolynomial-time adversary, even across multiple decoding attempts, in contrast\nto previous schemes. Our approach connects coding theory with complexity-based\nquantum cryptography, paving the way for secure quantum information processing\nin adversarial settings."

To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,\nsecure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to\nenhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,\nbut as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due\nto fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can\nsimultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel\nsecure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather\nthan a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's\ndata by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding\naccuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs\nsimilarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect\nprivacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based\nprotocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model\naccuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice."

Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it\noften introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational\noverhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by\njointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone\nmodels frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational\nconflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse\nMixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a\nflexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over\nself-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific\ngating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each\nframe, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.\nExperiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently\noutperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most\nchallenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT\nimproves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE\npre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with\nstatistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT\nimproves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and\nby 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline.

This\nthesis introduces robust and computationally efficient methods to address\nseveral common challenges associated with high-dimensional data. In my first\nmanuscript, I propose a coherent approach to variable screening that\naccommodates nonlinear associations. I develop a novel variable screening\nmethod that transcends traditional linear assumptions by leveraging mutual\ninformation, with an intended application in neuroimaging data.

These methods\naddress notable challenges in current statistical computing practices,\nfacilitating computationally efficient and robust analyses of complex datasets.\nThe proposed method can be applied to a general class of optimization problems.\nIn my third manuscript, I contribute to robust modeling of high-dimensional\ncorrelated observations by developing a mixed-effects model based on Tsallis\npower-law entropy maximization and discussed the theoretical properties of such\ndistribution. This model surpasses the constraints of conventional Gaussian\nmodels by accommodating a broader class of distributions with enhanced\nrobustness to outliers.

These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index\nselection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance\n(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity\nmore effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical\nuse.

We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum\nassignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic\nruntime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable\noperations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,\nFoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)\nthat generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss\nyields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in\nlow-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without\nadditional hyperparameter search.

To address this\nchallenge, we previously proposed DYNAMITE, a dynamic defense selection\napproach that identifies the most suitable defense against adversarial attacks\nthrough an ML-driven selection mechanism.

A\nprominent example is Google's V8 heap sandbox, which represents the most widely\ndeployed SFI mechanism, protecting billions of users across all Chromium-based\nbrowsers and countless applications built on Node$.$js and Electron. The heap\nsandbox splits the address space into two parts: one part containing trusted,\nsecurity-sensitive metadata, and a sandboxed heap containing memory accessible\nto untrusted code.

Electronic-photonic\nintegrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for\nnext-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high\nbandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and\ninterconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for\nsustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and\nlower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon\nfootprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,\nwhile delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and\ninterconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI\nsystems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and\ncross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We\npresent how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing\nboth chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer\ndevice-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for\nphotonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip\narea cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI\nworkloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by\ntolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with\nEPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and\nrobustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI\nsystems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously\nmeet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for\nsustainable computing."

While most prior work frames spoof detection as a binary\ntask, real-world attacks often involve hybrid utterances that mix genuine and\nsynthetic speech, making detection substantially more challenging. To address\nthis gap, we introduce the Hybrid Spoofed Audio Dataset (HSAD), a benchmark\ncontaining 1,248 clean and 41,044 degraded utterances across four classes:\nhuman, cloned, zero-shot AI-generated, and hybrid audio. Each sample is\nannotated with spoofing method, speaker identity, and degradation metadata to\nenable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate six transformer-based models,\nincluding spectrogram encoders (MIT-AST, MattyB95-AST) and self-supervised\nwaveform models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT). Results reveal critical lessons: pretrained\nmodels overgeneralize and collapse under hybrid conditions; spoof-specific\nfine-tuning improves separability but struggles with unseen compositions; and\ndataset-specific adaptation on HSAD yields large performance gains (AST greater\nthan 97 percent and F1 score is approximately 99 percent), though residual\nerrors persist for complex hybrids. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning\nalone is not sufficient-robust hybrid-aware benchmarks like HSAD are essential\nto expose calibration failures, model biases, and factors affecting spoof\ndetection in adversarial environments. HSAD thus provides both a dataset and an\nanalytic framework for building resilient and trustworthy voice authentication\nsystems."

However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely\nundermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.\nThese AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical\nmodifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and\nquantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \\& W, and\nDeepFool).

This\npaper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on\nResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network\narchitectures.

We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm\nparameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack\nconfigurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial\nalgorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on\nthe image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving\nan accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%.

        "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,\nparticularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal\ndependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate\nthe lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training\ndiscriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer\nfrom two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly\nknowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and\nAnomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too\nclosely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting\nclassification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable\nanomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a\nCutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted\nmanner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision\nstrategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly\nshift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional\nnetwork to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and\nESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated\ntraining data.

The practical value of R&S\ndepends on accurate simulation input modeling, which often suffers from the\ncurse of input uncertainty due to limited data. Distributionally robust ranking\nand selection (DRR&S) addresses this challenge by modeling input uncertainty\nvia an ambiguity set of $m > 1$ plausible input distributions, resulting in\n$km$ scenarios in total. Recent DRR&S studies suggest a key structural insight:\nadditivity in budget allocation is essential for efficiency. However, existing\njustifications are heuristic, and fundamental properties such as consistency\nand the precise allocation pattern induced by additivity remain poorly\nunderstood. In this paper, we propose a simple additive allocation (AA)\nprocedure that aims to exclusively sample the $k + m - 1$ previously\nhypothesized critical scenarios. Leveraging boundary-crossing arguments, we\nestablish a lower bound on the probability of correct selection and\ncharacterize the procedure's budget allocation behavior.

Developing reliable\nOOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of\nthese techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows\nresearchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to\nidentify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has\nproven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the\nperformance of a learning algorithm.

The proposed evaluation framework aims to\neffectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for\ntheir differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using\na conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based\non their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class\nhierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy\nto obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.\nThis framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution\nDetection (DCV-ROOD).

While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW\nconcepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or\ncelebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright\nand legal concerns.

Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding\nfeedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the\nzonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and\nhardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and\na convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a\nROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides\nstable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms\nof both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance."

We present TALOS, a lightweight\nframework for verifiable state management and trustworthy application\nmigration. While our implementation is prototyped and evaluated using Intel SGX\nwith the Gramine LibOS and RISC-V Keystone (evidencing the framework's\nportability across diverse TEEs), its design is agnostic to the underlying TEE\narchitecture. Such agility is a necessity in today's network service mesh\n(collaborative computing across the continuum) where application workloads must\nbe managed across domain boundaries in a harmonized fashion. TALOS is built\naround the principle of minimizing trust assumptions: TAs are treated as\nuntrusted until explicitly verified, and the migration process does not rely on\na trusted third party. To ensure both the integrity and secure launch of the\nmigrated application, TALOS integrates memory introspection and control-flow\ngraph extraction, enabling robust verification of state continuity and\nexecution flow.

To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved.

This effectively mitigates the limitations\ninherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token\ngeneration process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the\ninference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios.

To answer this question, we introduce a\nlarge-scale IPv6 scanning methodology that, unlike those that rely on AI, can\nbe run on low-resource devices common in IoT botnets.
