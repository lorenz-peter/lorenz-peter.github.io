        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking\nattacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce\nharmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns\nabout the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While\nexisting defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent\nadvancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods\nto circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense\nframeworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking\nthreats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary\nstudy demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against\na particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack\npattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a\nscalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive\nperformance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,\ncontributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon\npublication."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications\nranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main\napproaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and\njailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even\nagainst Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates\nadversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search\nspace over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding\nsuccessful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to\nlocal minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we\nassess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed\nthreat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment\nprocess. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the\nintermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting\nas a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly\neffective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show\nour informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show\na gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack\nperformance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to\nsuccessfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective\nacross diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,\neffective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,\nthat these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit\nalignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,\nour results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and\nthe need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs."

        "abstract": "Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data,\noffering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution\nacross data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their\ndeployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based\nsplit learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the\nserver while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to\nensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,\nefficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,\nleading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of\nLLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,\ncausing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack\nadaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a\nsecure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.\nFirst, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject\nGaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end\npropagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies\nto achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV\ncache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs\neffectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points\nfor input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware\nlimitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show\nthat FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and\nachieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of\nprivacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the\neffectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability."

We aim to\naddress this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream\ntasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal\nthat while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional\ntransformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images\nwithout any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%.\nLow-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate\nprotection across all attack types.

The Lightning Network is a payment channel\nnetwork built for Bitcoin that is already used in practice. Because the\nLightning Network is used for transfer of financial value, its security in the\npresence of adversarial participants should be verified. The Lightning\nprotocol's complexity makes it hard to assess whether the protocol is secure.\nTo enable computer-aided security verification of Lightning, we formalize the\nprotocol in TLA+ and formally specify the security property that honest users\nare guaranteed to retrieve their correct balance. While model checking provides\na fully automated verification of the security property, the state space of the\nprotocol's specification is so large that model checking becomes unfeasible. We\nmake model checking the Lightning Network possible using two refinement steps\nthat we verify using proofs. In a first step, we prove that the model of time\nused in the protocol can be abstracted using ideas from the research of timed\nautomata. In a second step, we prove that it suffices to model check the\nprotocol for single payment channels and the protocol for multi-hop payments\nseparately.

Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through\ndata poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an\nattacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a\nnormal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor\nattacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned\nlow-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR\nimages, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this\nproblem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR\nimages.

The poisoned HR images\ngenerated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers.

Existing GDRO algorithms\ncan only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and\ntherefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically.\nTo address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries\nand cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex\noptimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice\n(PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm,\nconstructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is\neither 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader.\nThen, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious\nPLA.

Among these attacks,\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks occur when multiple malicious\nentities collaborate to overwhelm and disrupt access to critical system\ncomponents, potentially causing severe performance degradation or complete\ndisruption of services. These attacks are particularly challenging to detect\ndue to their distributed nature and dynamic traffic patterns in NoC, which\noften evade static detection rules or simple profiling. This paper presents a\nframework to conduct topology-aware detection and localization of DDoS attacks\nusing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by analyzing NoC traffic patterns.\nSpecifically, by modeling the NoC as a graph, our method utilizes\nspatiotemporal traffic features to effectively identify and localize DDoS\nattacks.

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can detect and\nlocalize DDoS attacks with high accuracy (up to 99\\%) while maintaining\nconsistent performance under diverse attack strategies.

By comprehensively analyzing the\neffectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective\nhypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models,\nincluding Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable\nbehaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore\nprefix attacks can break all $\\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over\n$60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known\nLLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the\nneed to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies."

We consider the attacks where a\nreconstructor neural network learns to invert the (random) mapping between\ntraining data and model weights. Prior work has shown that an informed\nadversary with access to released model's weights and all but one training data\npoint can achieve high-quality reconstructions in this way. However,\ndifferential privacy can defend against such an attack with little to no loss\nin model's utility when the amount of training data is sufficiently large. In\nthis work we consider a more realistic adversary who only knows the\ndistribution from which a small training dataset has been sampled and who\nattacks a transfer-learned neural network classifier that has been trained on\nthis dataset. We exhibit an attack that works in this realistic threat model\nand demonstrate that in the small-data regime it cannot be defended against by\nDP-SGD without severely damaging the classifier accuracy. This raises\nsignificant concerns about the use of such transfer-learned classifiers when\nprotection of training-data is paramount. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our attack on VGG, EfficientNet and ResNet image classifiers\ntransfer-learned on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA respectively. Additionally, we\npoint out that the commonly used (true-positive) reconstruction success rate\nmetric fails to reliably quantify the actual reconstruction effectiveness.\nInstead, we make use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to construct the receiver\noperating characteristic curve and consider the associated true-positive\nreconstruction rate at a fixed level of the false-positive reconstruction rate."

In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing\nthat advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end\nLALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a\nnovel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio\ndoes not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal\njailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is\neffective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into\nperturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak\naudios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent\nconcealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios\nremain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the\nreverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation\nof the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot\noffer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness.\nMoreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully\nmanipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario.

On the contrary, we aim to detect and\nremove the attacks to mitigate their impact. Generalization contribution plays\na crucial role in distinguishing untargeted attacks. Our observations indicate\nthat, with limited data, the divergence between embeddings representing\ndifferent classes provides a better measure of generalization than direct\naccuracy. In light of this, we propose a novel robust aggregation method,\nFedGraM, designed to defend against untargeted attacks in FL. The server\nmaintains an auxiliary dataset containing one sample per class to support\naggregation. This dataset is fed to the local models to extract embeddings.\nThen, the server calculates the norm of the Gram Matrix of the embeddings for\neach local model. The norm serves as an indicator of each model's inter-class\nseparation capability in the embedding space. FedGraM identifies and removes\npotentially malicious models by filtering out those with the largest norms,\nthen averages the remaining local models to form the global model.

We provide a concrete\npayment mechanism for FOCIL, along with generalizable contributions to the\nliterature by analyzing 1) incentive compatibility of TFMs in the presence of a\nbribing adversary, 2) TFMs in protocols with multiple phases of transaction\ninclusion, and 3) TFMs of protocols in which parties are uncertain about the\nbehavior and the possible bribe of others."

Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL\n(MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a\nsurrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential\ngeneralization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL\nmethods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by\nmaximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy\nto maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective\nmismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for\neffective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via\noffline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial\nnoise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To\naddress these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model\nalongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving\nrobustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which\nwe solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide\ntheoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally\nefficient implementations.

Traditional mitigation\ntechniques, such as static differential privacy, rely on injecting a fixed\namount of noise during training or inference. However, this approach often\nleads to a detrimental trade-off: the noise may be insufficient to counter\nsophisticated attacks or, when increased, may substantially degrade model\nperformance. In this paper, we present DynaNoise, an adaptive approach that\ndynamically modulates noise injection based on query sensitivity. Our approach\nperforms sensitivity analysis using measures such as Shannon entropy to\nevaluate the risk associated with each query and adjusts the noise variance\naccordingly. A probabilistic smoothing step is then applied to renormalize the\nperturbed outputs, ensuring that the model maintains high accuracy while\neffectively obfuscating membership signals.

First, there's a lack of adequate\nbenchmarks for models to explore. Existing UAD datasets have limited attack\ntypes and samples, restricting the model's ability to address advanced threats.\nTo address this, we propose UniAttackDataPlus (UniAttackData+), the most\nextensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques to date.

Nevertheless, we recognize two major challenges in implementing\nSA for FD. (i) Prior SA designs encourage a dominant server, who is solely\nresponsible for collecting, aggregating and distributing.

Previous works often interpret this\nphenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that\naim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a\ndifferent context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to\nlearning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.\nIn this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a\nnovel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by\npreventing them from learning spuriosity.

While extensive studies have examined the performance\nand structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks\nremain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we\ntheoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank\nstructure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data\npoisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models\nLoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the\nanalysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish\nconnections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against\ntraining-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better\nrobustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more\nvulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information\ngeometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical\nfindings."

However, current causality-inspired robustness methods\npossess finite-radius robustness guarantees only in the linear settings, where\nthe causal relationships among the covariates and the response are linear.

In the face analytics domain, such\nembeddings are commonly used for biometric recognition (e.g., face\nidentification). However, these embeddings, or templates, can inadvertently\nexpose sensitive attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity. Leaking such\ninformation can compromise personal privacy and affect civil liberty and human\nrights. To address these concerns, we introduce a multi-layer protection\nframework for embeddings. It consists of a sequence of operations: (a)\nencrypting embeddings using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and (b) hashing\nthem using irreversible feature manifold hashing. Unlike conventional\nencryption methods, FHE enables computations directly on encrypted data,\nallowing downstream analytics while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. To\nreduce the overhead of encrypted processing, we employ embedding compression.\nOur proposed method shields latent representations of sensitive data from\nleaking private attributes (such as age and gender) while retaining essential\nfunctional capabilities (such as face identification).

In this paper, we argue\nthat such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all\nmodels should be identical across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we\ncan use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without\nsacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA),\nwhich dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained\nmodels) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling\nwithin-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity.In this way, the number of\nwithin-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only\ncross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability.\nExperiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various\nscenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models,\nSEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same\nefficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such\nas commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models.

In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a\nnovel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS\napplications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the\nadversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent\nconfigurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public\nAPI, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent.\nInspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts,\nMASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain\nresponses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components,\nincluding the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task\ninstructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS\napplications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world\nMAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI.

Although\nresearchers have proposed numerous defense algorithms, two significant\nchallenges remain. The attack is becoming more stealthy and harder to detect,\nand current defense methods are unable to handle 50\\% or more malicious users\nor assume an auxiliary server dataset.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense algorithm, FL-PLAS,\n\\textbf{F}ederated \\textbf{L}earning based on \\textbf{P}artial\\textbf{ L}ayer\n\\textbf{A}ggregation \\textbf{S}trategy. In particular, we divide the local\nmodel into a feature extractor and a classifier. In each iteration, the clients\nonly upload the parameters of a feature extractor after local training. The\nserver then aggregates these local parameters and returns the results to the\nclients.\n  Each client retains its own classifier layer, ensuring that the backdoor\nlabels do not impact other clients. We assess the effectiveness of FL-PLAS\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on three image datasets and\ncompare our approach to six defense strategies.

        "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into a wide range of\napplications has highlighted the critical role of well-crafted system prompts,\nwhich require extensive testing and domain expertise. These prompts enhance\ntask performance but may also encode sensitive information and filtering\ncriteria, posing security risks if exposed. Recent research shows that system\nprompts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, while existing defenses are\neither easily bypassed or require constant updates to address new threats. In\nthis work, we introduce ProxyPrompt, a novel defense mechanism that prevents\nprompt leakage by replacing the original prompt with a proxy. This proxy\nmaintains the original task's utility while obfuscating the extracted prompt,\nensuring attackers cannot reproduce the task or access sensitive information.\nComprehensive evaluations on 264 LLM and system prompt pairs show that\nProxyPrompt protects 94.70% of prompts from extraction attacks, outperforming\nthe next-best defense, which only achieves 42.80%."

        "abstract": "The proliferation of AI agents requires robust mechanisms for secure\ndiscovery. This paper introduces the Agent Name Service (ANS), a novel\narchitecture based on DNS addressing the lack of a public agent discovery\nframework. ANS provides a protocol-agnostic registry infrastructure that\nleverages Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates for verifiable agent\nidentity and trust. The architecture features several key innovations: a\nformalized agent registration and renewal mechanism for lifecycle management;\nDNS-inspired naming conventions with capability-aware resolution; a modular\nProtocol Adapter Layer supporting diverse communication standards (A2A, MCP,\nACP etc.); and precisely defined algorithms for secure resolution. We implement\nstructured communication using JSON Schema and conduct a comprehensive threat\nanalysis of our proposal.

        "abstract": "The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the\nobservation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate\nthat these insights will inspire new training strategies and model\narchitectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer\nparameters."

To address this challenge, we propose a sybil-based virtual data\npoisoning attack, where a malicious client generates sybil nodes to amplify the\npoisoning model's impact. To reduce neural network computational complexity, we\ndevelop a virtual data generation method based on gradient matching.

Using synthetic data\nfor successive training of future model generations creates \"self-consuming\nloops\", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore,\nsynthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on\ntheir preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is\ncurated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop\ndrives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those\npreferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or\nadversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit\nmalicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this\npaper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining\nloops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the\nimpact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions\nfor the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we\ndesign attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a\nplatform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's\nmodel from actual user preferences.

        "abstract": "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has transformed network architectures by\ndecoupling the control and data-planes, enabling fine-grained control over\npacket processing and forwarding. P4, a language designed for programming\ndata-plane devices, allows developers to define custom packet processing\nbehaviors directly on programmable network devices. This provides greater\ncontrol over packet forwarding, inspection, and modification. However, the\nincreased flexibility provided by P4 also brings significant security\nchallenges, particularly in managing sensitive data and preventing information\nleakage within the data-plane.\n  This paper presents a novel security type system for analyzing information\nflow in P4 programs that combines security types with interval analysis. The\nproposed type system allows the specification of security policies in terms of\ninput and output packet bit fields rather than program variables. We formalize\nthis type system and prove it sound, guaranteeing that well-typed programs\nsatisfy noninterference. Our prototype implementation, Tap4s, is evaluated on\nseveral use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting security\nviolations and information leakages."

        "abstract": "In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant\nprogress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on\nbandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated\naudio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To\naddress this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN),\na novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU\nactivation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This\ninnovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce\nintricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN\nmodule for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution\noperations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and\nfidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator\nnetwork using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and\ngenerated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions\nof the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M\nparameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both\nspeech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of\nthe DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers\nsuperior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its\nrobustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN\noutperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics,\nand exhibits increased robustness in synthesized audio."

Our approach employs convolutional layers that exploit locality\nbias to capture strong correlations between neighboring channel elements,\ncombined with a transformer encoder that applies the global Attention mechanism\nto channel patches. This approach effectively models both long-range\ndependencies and spectro-temporal interactions within single OFDM frames. We\nfurther augment the model's adaptability by integrating nonlinear\nrepresentations of available channel statistics SNR, delay spread, and Doppler\nshift as priors. A residual connection is employed to merge global features\nfrom the transformer with local features from early convolutional processing,\nfollowed by final convolutional layers to refine the hierarchical channel\nrepresentation. Despite its compact architecture, AdaFortiTran achieves up to 6\ndB reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models.\nTested across a wide range of Doppler shifts (200-1000 Hz), SNRs (0 to 25 dB),\nand delay spreads (50-300 ns), it demonstrates superior robustness in\nhigh-mobility environments."

However,\nphysiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels\nhinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain\nadaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,\nespecially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and\nunlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level\nself-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory\nbuffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and\npseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling\ngeneralization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for\nemotion recognition.

Key components of the framework, including a fast\nadaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and\neffective handling of evolving data streams.

The error term captures both the estimation error due to finite\nnumber of samples and the approximation error from using a restricted\nhypothesis class. For linear predictive models, we derive closed-form bounds,\nwhich are order optimal in terms of the noise variance, on the approximation\nerror for several classes of relationships between the sensitive and\nnon-sensitive features, including linear mappings, binary symmetric channels,\nand class-conditional multi-variate Gaussian distributions.

Therefore, how to reveal the security vulnerabilities of existing\nvisual trackers through effective adversarial attacks has become a critical\nproblem that needs to be addressed. To this end, we propose an adaptive\nmeta-gradient adversarial attack (AMGA) method for visual tracking. This method\nintegrates multi-model ensembles and meta-learning strategies, combining\nmomentum mechanisms and Gaussian smoothing, which can significantly enhance the\ntransferability and attack effectiveness of adversarial examples. AMGA randomly\nselects models from a large model repository, constructs diverse tracking\nscenarios, and iteratively performs both white- and black-box adversarial\nattacks in each scenario, optimizing the gradient directions of each model.\nThis paradigm minimizes the gap between white- and black-box adversarial\nattacks, thus achieving excellent attack performance in black-box scenarios.\nExtensive experimental results on large-scale datasets such as OTB2015, LaSOT,\nand GOT-10k demonstrate that AMGA significantly improves the attack\nperformance, transferability, and deception of adversarial examples.
