        "abstract": "Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models\n(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but\nalso serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.

        "abstract": "Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.\nHowever, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from\nhistorical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a\nmajor asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data\navailable for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer\nfor Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this\nasymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed\nweather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict\nrich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows\nthe model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during\ndeployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all\nevaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under\nnormal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme\nweather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p\n\\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN\nusing less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in\ndata-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can\novercome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a\nchanging climate."

To address\nthese challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL\nframework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs).

Leveraging this, we\ndesign a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from LoRA-A\nto filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose\nprojection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while\nsuppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the\nglobal directions.

However, unlike\nfixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera\nmovement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural\nintegrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address\nthese challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network\n(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy\nvideos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction\nand Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)\nmodule. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature\nrepresentation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,\nsparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in\nfeature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch\ninformation exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen\nmulti-scale feature integration.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we endeavor to address the challenges of backdoor attacks\ncountermeasures in black-box scenarios, thereby fortifying the security of\ninference under MLaaS. We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new\nperspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into:\nhigh-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and\nlow-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a\nprogressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these triggers from the\nmost conspicuous to the most subtle, without requiring model access. First, for\nHVTs, which create the most significant local semantic distortions, we identify\nand eliminate them by detecting these salient differences. We then restore the\npatched area to mitigate the adverse impact of such removal process. The\nlocalized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs,\nwhich globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned\ninput as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally\ntreat the benign features as \"noise\". This formulation allows us to reconstruct\nSVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign \"noise\"\nfeatures. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed\ntrigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we\nintroduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM\nto restore any collateral impact on clean features. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Compared\nwith baselines, BDFirewall reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average\nof 33.25%, improving poisoned sample accuracy (PA) by 29.64%, and achieving up\nto a 111x speedup in inference time.

        "abstract": "Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,\nsaccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial\nrobots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body\nacceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot\ninertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high\nsusceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers\nrequires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the\nhardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and\nenvironmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube\nmodel predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and\nrobustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive\ncontroller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To\nachieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we\ndesign imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural\nnetwork, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of\ncentral nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like\nsaccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per\nsecond and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\\%$ and 255$\\%$\nimprovement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers\nunder 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force\nmapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11\nseconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results\nrepresent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire\nfuture investigations on sensing and compute autonomy."

Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection\nare either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against\ntransformer-based detectors.

By design, AFOG\nis neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large\ntransformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a\nunified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original\ncontributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments\nconducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the\nefficacy of AFOG.

In addition, unlike existing\nmodels that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local\ninformation, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and\nsimultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular\nchanges. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale\nfusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different\nresolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818\ncolor fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic\nvariables from 2,741 subjects.

For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available.

This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation\nproblem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its\ninvestment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks,\nand reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes.\nThis encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the\nobservation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this\nuncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate\nhow the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment\nin the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be\nachieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive\nresources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with\nhigher sensor quality.

Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and\ndiscarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication\nefficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to\nmatch the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and\neffectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label\nflipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant\nimprovements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future\nintelligent wireless networks."

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT\nobjective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change\nsmoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust\nPerception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the\ncurrent accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nTiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) works.

In stark contrast, for\nsubgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain\nessentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally\nintractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust.

To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack\n(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access\nto the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training\nconfiguration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA\ncombines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and\nTargeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images\nby simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual\nstrategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized\noutputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA\nachieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates\nnear 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically\nfine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image\njailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits\ninherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing\ntransferability.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nBackdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial\nKnowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense\neffectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned\ndata. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned\ndata, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small\nset of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is\ndesigned to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a\ncycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean\nand identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream\nattacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without\nsignificantly reducing the CACC.

For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods.

When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well.

        "abstract": "Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for\nmulti-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.\nHowever, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark\nsuites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more\nrealistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first\ninvestigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the\nsource-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we\nidentify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)\ndisparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source\nmodels. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector\nConditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task\nvectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a\ntask vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its\nessential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that\nby pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging\ntechniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --\nwhere they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains."

Despite\ngrowing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on\nprotocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the\nfundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal\nbounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,\nwhere no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the\nproblem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic\nperspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,\neach holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who\naim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires\nthat no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up\nto $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies\nthe minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In\nparticular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input\nsum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at\nleast one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no\nfewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols.

However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD\ninherently robust to variety defenses.

Accurate VAD is essential in\nautomatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where\nnoise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the\nvoice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)\ndevices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice\nsignal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain\nlight-weight due to their practical on-device limitation.

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while\npreserving general performance."

For example, an attacker controlling the\noperating system, and consequently the scheduling algorithm, may arbitrarily\nmanipulate their local TEE's clock speed. What is worse, in case of faster\nmalicious clock speeds, an attacker on a single compromised machine may\npropagate the attack to honest machines participating in Triad's Trusted Time\nprotocol, causing them to skip to timestamps arbitrarily far in the future.\nThen, infected honest machines propagate time-skips themselves to other honest\nmachines interacting with them.

With the growing capabilities of neural networks, it is\nnatural to explore their potential application in the design of cryptographic\nprimitives. Neural networks inherently captures the non-linear relationships\nwithin the data, which are encoded in their synaptic weight matrices and bias\nvectors.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To\nmitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase\napproximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned\ndata traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from\n\"pseudo-convergence\", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but\nstill preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification\nand generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach\nmaintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack\naccuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full\nretraining from scratch."

        "abstract": "Fintech provides technological services to increase operational efficiency in\nfinancial institutions, but traditional perimeter-based defense mechanisms are\ninsufficient against evolving cyber threats like insider attacks, malware\nintrusions, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These vulnerabilities\nexpose Fintech organizations to significant risks, including financial losses\nand data breaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nblockchain-integrated Zero Trust framework, adhering to the principle of \"Never\nTrust, Always Verify.\" The framework uses Ethereum smart contracts to enforce\nMulti Factor Authentication (MFA), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and\nJust-In-Time (JIT) access privileges, effectively mitigating credential theft\nand insider threats, the effect of malware and APT attacks.\n  The proposed solution transforms blockchain into a Policy Engine (PE) and\nPolicy Enforcement Point (PEP), and policy storage, ensuring immutable access\ncontrol and micro-segmentation. A decentralized application (DApp) prototype\nwas developed and tested using STRIDE threat modeling, demonstrating resilience\nagainst spoofing, tampering, and privilege escalation. Comparative analysis\nwith Perimeter-based systems revealed a trade-off: while the framework\nintroduced a marginal latency increase (74.0 ms vs. 49.33 ms) and reduced\nthroughput (30.77 vs. 50.0 requests/sec), it significantly enhanced security by\neliminating single points of failure and enabling tamper-proof audit trails.\n  Experimental validation on a 200-node simulated network confirmed the\nframework's robustness, with future optimizations targeting Layer-2 solutions\nfor scalability. This work bridges the gap between Zero Trust theory and\npractical blockchain implementation, offering Fintech organizations a\ndecentralized, cost-effective security model."

To further explore the field of backdoor attacks\nagainst semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective\nbackdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg\nleverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models\nto enhance backdoor performance.

Building\nupon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class\nand rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship\nbetween the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier.

Critically, ChoreoMuse supports\nstyle-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical\ngenres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to\nhandle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel\nmusic encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the\ngenerated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the\ninput music.

        "abstract": "Computers and computer networks have become integral to virtually every\naspect of modern life, with the Internet playing an indispensable role.\nOrganizations, businesses, and individuals now store vast amounts of\nproprietary, confidential, and personal data digitally. As such, ensuring the\nsecurity of this data from unauthorized access is critical. Common security\nmeasures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion\nprevention systems (IPS), and antivirus software, are constantly evolving to\nsafeguard computer systems and networks. However, these tools primarily focus\non defending against external threats, leaving systems vulnerable to insider\nattacks. Security solutions designed to mitigate risks originating from within\nthe organization are relatively limited and often ineffective. This paper\ndemonstrates how a Local Area Network (LAN) can be covertly exposed to the\nInternet via an insider attack. Specifically, it illustrates how an external\nmachine can gain access to a LAN by exploiting an unused secondary IP address\nof the attacked LAN, effectively bypassing existing security mechanisms by also\nexploiting Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Despite the presence of robust\nexternal protections, such as firewalls and IDS, this form of insider attack\nreveals significant vulnerabilities in the way internal threats are addressed."

        "abstract": "Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in\nvarious downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from\nlow-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common\nissue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data\ncollected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a\nRectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted\nrectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving\nintricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we\nfurther incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts\nbased on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and\nadaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently\nunify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point\ncloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete\npoint cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, we\nintroduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)\nbenchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,\nto fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained\nmodels, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:\nWiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and\nWiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing.

In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel\nadversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and\nundefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)\nrepresentations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting\npoint clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point\nclouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric\nstructure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,\nMAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain\neffective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting\nand prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the\noptimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and\nundefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and\nundefendability.

As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively\nenhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error\npatterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of\n$3\\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction\naccuracy by at least 20\\% when errors present in model weights or node\nembeddings, and by at least 10\\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most\nwidespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and\nremarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is\nrelatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA\nfine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).\nHowever, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more\ninformation leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we\nintroduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the\nfine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership\ninference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that\nleverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply\nLoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language\nprocessing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still\nvulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).\nWe also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the\nresulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only\ndropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively\nmitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the\n\"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model\nmakes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can\nprovide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers."
