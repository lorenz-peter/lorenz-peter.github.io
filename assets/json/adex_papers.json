        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-quality tabular synthetic data. In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08862v1",
        "abstract": "Underground mining operations depend on sensor networks to monitor critical parameters such as temperature, gas concentration, and miner movement, enabling timely hazard detection and safety decisions. However, transmitting raw sensor data to a centralized server for machine learning (ML) model training raises serious privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative by enabling decentralized model training without exposing sensitive local data. Yet, applying FL in underground mining presents unique challenges: (i) Adversaries may eavesdrop on shared model updates to launch model inversion or membership inference attacks, compromising data privacy and operational safety; (ii) Non-IID data distributions across mines and sensor noise can hinder model convergence. To address these issues, we propose FedMining--a privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for underground mining. FedMining introduces two core innovations: (1) a Decentralized Functional Encryption (DFE) scheme that keeps local models encrypted, thwarting unauthorized access and inference attacks; and (2) a balancing aggregation mechanism to mitigate data heterogeneity and enhance convergence. Evaluations on real-world mining datasets demonstrate FedMining's ability to safeguard privacy while maintaining high model accuracy and achieving rapid convergence with reduced communication and computation overhead. These advantages make FedMining both secure and practical for real-time underground safety monitoring."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08832v1",
        "abstract": "With the increasing reliance on AI models for weather forecasting, it is imperative to evaluate their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns. These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards to protect against adversarial exploitation in operational forecasting systems."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08802v1",
        "abstract": "Despite advancements in machine learning for security, rule-based detection remains prevalent in Security Operations Centers due to the resource intensiveness and skill gap associated with ML solutions. While traditional rule-based methods offer efficiency, their rigidity leads to high false positives or negatives and requires continuous manual maintenance. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid framework to democratize ML-based threat detection. The first stage employs intentionally loose YARA rules for coarse-grained filtering, optimized for high recall. The second stage utilizes an ML classifier to filter out false positives from the first stage's output. To overcome data scarcity, the system leverages Simula, a seedless synthetic data generation framework, enabling security analysts to create high-quality training datasets without extensive data science expertise or pre-labeled examples. A continuous feedback loop incorporates real-time investigation results to adaptively tune the ML model, preventing rule degradation.\n  This proposed model with active learning has been rigorously tested for a prolonged time in a production environment spanning tens of thousands of systems. The system handles initial raw log volumes often reaching 250 billion events per day, significantly reducing them through filtering and ML inference to a handful of daily tickets for human investigation. Live experiments over an extended timeline demonstrate a general improvement in the model's precision over time due to the active learning feature. This approach offers a self-sustained, low-overhead, and low-maintenance solution, allowing security professionals to guide model learning as expert ``teachers''."

        "abstract": "Driver distraction behavior recognition using in-vehicle cameras demands real-time inference on edge devices. However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions. ROI-based methods also increase computational cost, making it difficult to balance efficiency and accuracy. This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains. These results confirm C-DIRA's effectiveness in achieving compactness, efficiency, and generalization."

This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals. We evaluate the approach on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, which mirrors the long-horizon structure of many robotic manipulation and planning tasks. Results demonstrate improved stability, reduced oracle usage, and stronger long-range reasoning from distributed agent cooperation."

In addition, the data distribution problem of color images has not been systematically elaborated and explained, so that there is still the lack of the theory about measuring different color images datasets. In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality."

Existing privacy protection techniques, primarily designed for perception-based models, prove ineffective against MLRMs' sophisticated multi-step reasoning processes that analyze environmental cues. We introduce \\textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \\textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations. Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrates ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness, achieving a 14.4\\% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8\\% vs 19.4\\%) and nearly doubling block-level protection (33.5\\% vs 16.8\\%).

        "abstract": "Subset selection-based methods are widely used to explain deep vision models: they attribute predictions by highlighting the most influential image regions and support object-level explanations. While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications."

However, LLM-empowered applications are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where instructions are injected via untrustworthy external data sources. This paper presents Rennervate, a defense framework to detect and prevent IPI attacks. Rennervate leverages attention features to detect the covert injection at a fine-grained token level, enabling precise sanitization that neutralizes IPI attacks while maintaining LLM functionalities. Specifically, the token-level detector is materialized with a 2-step attentive pooling mechanism, which aggregates attention heads and response tokens for IPI detection and sanitization. Moreover, we establish a fine-grained IPI dataset, FIPI, to be open-sourced to support further research. Extensive experiments verify that Rennervate outperforms 15 commercial and academic IPI defense methods, achieving high precision on 5 LLMs and 6 datasets. We also demonstrate that Rennervate is transferable to unseen attacks and robust against adaptive adversaries."

We collected and analyzed 3,546 cases of vulnerabilities in upgradable contracts,covering common vulnerability categories such as reentrancy, access control flaws, and integer overflow. Experimental results show that USCSA achieves an accuracy of 92.3%, recall of 89.7%, and F1-score of 91.0% in detecting upgrade-induced vulnerabilities.\n  In addition, the efficiency of mapping high-risk changes has achieved a 30% improvement over the conventional approach. As a result, USCSA provides a significant advantage to improve the security and integrity of upgradable smart contracts, providing a novel and efficient solution to secure audits on blockchain applications."

However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities."

This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) aims to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of risks in the MCP ecosystem, distinguishing between adversarial security threats (e.g., indirect prompt injection, tool poisoning) and epistemic safety hazards (e.g., alignment failures in distributed tool delegation). We analyze the structural vulnerabilities of MCP primitives, specifically Resources, Prompts, and Tools, and demonstrate how \"context\" can be weaponized to trigger unauthorized operations in multi-agent environments. Furthermore, we survey state-of-the-art defenses, ranging from cryptographic provenance (ETDI) to runtime intent verification, and conclude with a roadmap for securing the transition from conversational chatbots to autonomous agentic operating systems."

In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing MIRAGE, a novel multi-stage poisoning pipeline designed for strict black-box and query-agnostic environments. Operating on surrogate model feedback, MIRAGE functions as an automated optimization framework that integrates three key mechanisms: it utilizes persona-driven query synthesis to approximate latent user search distributions, employs semantic anchoring to imperceptibly embed these intents for high retrieval visibility, and leverages an adversarial variant of Test-Time Preference Optimization (TPO) to maximize persuasion. To rigorously evaluate this threat, we construct a new benchmark derived from three long-form, domain-specific datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIRAGE significantly outperforms existing baselines in both attack efficacy and stealthiness, exhibiting remarkable transferability across diverse retriever-LLM configurations and highlighting the urgent need for robust defense strategies."

Further, when these capabilities are integrated with advanced automation technologies, the concept essentially evolves into connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). While connected vehicles primarily focus on seamless information sharing, autonomous vehicles are mainly dependent on advanced perception, decision-making, and control mechanisms to operate with minimal or without human intervention. However, as a result of connectivity, an adversary with malicious intentions might be able to compromise successfully by breaching the system components of CAVs. In this paper, we present an attack-tree based methodology for evaluating cyber security vulnerabilities in CAVs. In particular, we utilize the attack-defense tree formulation to systematically assess attack-leaf vulnerabilities, and before analyzing the vulnerability indices, we also define a measure of vulnerabilities, which is based on existing cyber security threats and corresponding defensive countermeasures."

We propose AIDR, a hybrid cloud-edge framework that addresses this trade-off through constrained information-density optimization. The core innovation is gradient-based compression of reasoning chains to retain only decision-critical steps--minimal evidence sufficient to justify predictions while respecting token and latency budgets. We demonstrate that this approach preserves decision-relevant information while minimizing complexity. We construct compact datasets by distilling alerts into 3-5 high-information bullets (68% token reduction), train domain-specialized experts via LoRA, and deploy a cloud-edge architecture: a cloud LLM routes alerts to on-premises experts generating SOAR-ready JSON. Experiments demonstrate AIDR achieves higher accuracy and 40.6% latency reduction versus Chain-of-Thought, with robustness to data corruption and out-of-distribution generalization, enabling auditable and efficient SOC triage with full data residency compliance."

        "abstract": "The growing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in various applications underscores the need for agents that can successfully navigate and adapt to an ever-changing, open-ended world. A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the robustness of Nash equilibria in continuous games, under both strategic and dynamic uncertainty. Starting with the former, we introduce the notion of a robust equilibrium as those equilibria that remain invariant to small -- but otherwise arbitrary -- perturbations to the game's payoff structure, and we provide a crisp geometric characterization thereof. Subsequently, we turn to the question of dynamic robustness, and we examine which equilibria may arise as stable limit points of the dynamics of \"follow the regularized leader\" (FTRL) in the presence of randomness and uncertainty. Despite their very distinct origins, we establish a structural correspondence between these two notions of robustness: strategic robustness implies dynamic robustness, and, conversely, the requirement of strategic robustness cannot be relaxed if dynamic robustness is to be maintained. Finally, we examine the rate of convergence to robust equilibria as a function of the underlying regularizer, and we show that entropically regularized learning converges at a geometric rate in games with affinely constrained action spaces."

        "abstract": "As AI agents increasingly operate in real-world, multi-agent environments, ensuring reliable and context-aware privacy in agent communication is critical, especially to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. Traditional access controls are insufficient, as privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may use information in ways that compromise privacy, such as messaging humans, sharing context with other agents, making tool calls, persisting data, or generating derived private information. Existing approaches often treat privacy as a binary constraint, whether data is shareable or not, overlooking nuanced, role-specific, and computation-dependent privacy needs essential for regulatory compliance.\n  Agents, including those based on large language models, are inherently probabilistic and heuristic. There is no formal guarantee of how an agent will behave for any query, making them ill-suited for operations critical to security. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a four-tiered framework for fine-grained, encrypted agent communication that adds a protection layer atop any AI agent platform. AgentCrypt spans unrestricted data exchange (Level 1) to fully encrypted computation using techniques such as homomorphic encryption (Level 4). Crucially, it guarantees the privacy of tagged data is always maintained, prioritizing privacy above correctness.\n  AgentCrypt ensures privacy across diverse interactions and enables computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers such as data silos. We implemented and tested it with Langgraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across platforms. We also introduce a benchmark dataset simulating privacy-critical tasks at all privacy levels, enabling systematic evaluation and fostering the development of regulatable machine learning systems for secure agent communication and computation."

        "abstract": "Crisis classification in social media aims to extract actionable disaster-related information from multimodal posts, which is a crucial task for enhancing situational awareness and facilitating timely emergency responses. However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios."

        "abstract": "Distribution shifts at test time degrade image classifiers. Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\\ low vs.\\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\\%/19.8\\%/39.2\\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations further show that simple random masking is effective and robust. These results indicate that a simple random masking schedule, coupled with consistency and entropy objectives, is sufficient to drive effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals."

The architecture consists of two collaborative modules: an F module, which conducts efficient frequency domain preprocessing to alleviate poor local minima, and a T module, which ensures accurate and stable local computations, backed by a stability estimate. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves a balanced trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, which yields competitive quantitative results and improved visual quality compared to pure convolutional neural network (CNN) based models, while achieving performance close to that of transformer-based method with reasonable computational expense."

        "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of spinal structures in X-ray images is a prerequisite for quantitative scoliosis assessment, including Cobb angle measurement, vertebral translation estimation and curvature classification. In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations."

        "abstract": "Ensuring the authenticity of video content remains challenging as DeepFake generation becomes increasingly realistic and robust against detection. Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues. Extensive experiments on FF++, Celeb-DFv2, and DFDC demonstrate that LR-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved robustness under severe global and local disruptions, including missing faces, occlusions, and adversarially perturbed face detections."

Our method constrains 2D Gaussians to localized regions and infers their attributes via hierarchical neural features on mesh faces. Gaussian subdivision is guided by an adaptive face subdivision strategy driven by a detail-aware loss function. Additionally, we leverage priors from a reconstruction foundation model to initialize Gaussian deformations, enabling robust reconstruction of general dynamic objects from a single static camera, previously extremely challenging for optimization-based methods. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method, reducing LPIPS by 29.1% and Chamfer distance by 49.2% on appearance and mesh reconstruction tasks."

Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets. These findings confirm that hierarchy-based fusion enhances robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual modalities and demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-agent approach in addressing diverse types of manipulations in deepfakes."

Yet the susceptibility of modern smartphones to physical side-channel analysis (SCA) is underexplored, with recent work limited to pre-2019 hardware. Since then, smartphone system on chip (SoC) platforms have grown more complex, with heterogeneous processor clusters, sub 10 nm nodes, and frequencies over 2 GHz, potentially complicating SCA. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of electromagnetic (EM) SCA on a Raspberry Pi 4, featuring a Broadcom BCM2711 SoC and a Fairphone 4 featuring a Snapdragon 750G 5G SoC. Using new attack methodologies tailored to modern SoCs, we recover ECDSA secrets from OpenSSL by mounting the Nonce@Once attack of Alam et al. (Euro S&P 2021) and show that the libgcrypt countermeasure does not fully mitigate it. We present case studies illustrating how hardware and software stacks impact EM SCA feasibility. Motivated by use cases such as the EUDI wallet, we survey Android cryptographic implementations and define representative threat models to assess the attack. Our findings show weaknesses in ECDSA software implementations and underscore the need for independently certified secure elements (SEs) in all smartphones."

Yet, endoscopic videos are often degraded by uneven illumination, tissue scattering, occlusions, and motion blur, which obscure critical anatomical details and complicate surgical manipulation. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promise in image enhancement, most existing approaches remain too computationally demanding for real-time surgical use. To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of degradation-aware modeling for real-time endoscopic video enhancement. Nevertheless, our method suggests that implicitly learning and propagating degradation representation offer a practical pathway for clinical application."

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing."

Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories."

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational components in a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding and generation, embodied intelligence, and scientific discovery. As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops. These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals. In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments. The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity. The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services. Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07030v1",
        "abstract": "Among the various types of cyberattacks, identifying zero-day attacks is problematic because they are unknown to security systems as their pattern and characteristics do not match known blacklisted attacks. There are many Machine Learning (ML) models designed to analyze and detect network attacks, especially using supervised models. However, these models are designed to classify samples (normal and attacks) based on the patterns they learn during the training phase, so they perform inefficiently on unseen attacks. This research addresses this issue by evaluating five different supervised models to assess their performance and execution time in predicting zero-day attacks and find out which model performs accurately and quickly. The goal is to improve the performance of these supervised models by not only proposing a framework that applies grid search, dimensionality reduction and oversampling methods to overcome the imbalance problem, but also comparing the effectiveness of oversampling on ml model metrics, in particular the accuracy. To emulate attack detection in real life, this research applies a highly imbalanced data set and only exposes the classifiers to zero-day attacks during the testing phase, so the models are not trained to flag the zero-day attacks. Our results show that Random Forest (RF) performs best under both oversampling and non-oversampling conditions, this increased effectiveness comes at the cost of longer processing times. Therefore, we selected XG Boost (XGB) as the top model due to its fast and highly accurate performance in detecting zero-day attacks."

        "abstract": "Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enforcing safety in optimization-based controllers, and their integration with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has enabled the specification-driven synthesis of complex robotic behaviors. However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and myopic, per-time step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that embeds trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) into a differentiable Quadratic Program (dQP). Our approach provides a systematic procedure for constructing time-varying HOCBF constraints for a broad fragment of STL and introduces a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, QP feasibility, and control-bound compliance. Three neural networks-InitNet, RefNet, and an extended BarrierNet-collaborate to generate reference inputs and adapt constraint-related hyperparameters automatically over time and across initial conditions, reducing conservativeness while maximizing robustness. The resulting controller achieves STL satisfaction with strictly feasible dQPs and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments."

Despite its success, this paradigm can generate erroneous pseudo-labels, which are further amplified during training due to utilization of one-hot encoding. To address this issue, we propose ECOCSeg, a novel perspective for segmentation models that utilizes error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to create a fine-grained encoding for each class. ECOCSeg offers several advantages. First, an ECOC-based classifier is introduced, enabling model to disentangle classes into attributes and handle partial inaccurate bits, improving stability and generalization in pseudo-label learning. Second, a bit-level label denoising mechanism is developed to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels, providing adequate and robust supervision for unlabeled images. ECOCSeg can be easily integrated with existing methods and consistently demonstrates significant improvements on multiple UDA and SSL benchmarks across different segmentation architectures.

However, existing 3DGS watermarking methods remain highly vulnerable to diffusion-based editing, which can easily erase embedded provenance. This challenge highlights the urgent need for 3DGS watermarking techniques that are intrinsically resilient to diffusion-based editing. In this paper, we introduce RDSplat, a Robust watermarking paradigm against Diffusion editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting. RDSplat embeds watermarks into 3DGS components that diffusion-based editing inherently preserve, achieved through (i) proactively targeting low-frequency Gaussians and (ii) adversarial training with a diffusion proxy. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain framework that operates natively in 3DGS space and embeds watermarks into diffusion-editing-preserved low-frequency Gaussians via coordinated covariance regularization and 2D filtering. In addition, we exploit the low-pass filtering behavior of diffusion-based editing by using Gaussian blur as an efficient training surrogate, enabling adversarial fine-tuning that further enhances watermark robustness against diffusion-based editing. Empirically, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RDSplat not only maintains superior robustness under diffusion-based editing, but also preserves watermark invisibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

However, existing LLM-driven UAV systems process sensitive operational data in plaintext, exposing them to privacy and security risks. This work introduces PrivLLMSwarm, a privacy-preserving framework that performs secure LLM inference for UAV swarm coordination through Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). The framework incorporates MPC-optimized transformer components with efficient approximations of nonlinear activations, enabling practical encrypted inference on resource-constrained aerial platforms. A fine-tuned GPT-based command generator, enhanced through reinforcement learning in simulation, provides reliable instructions while maintaining confidentiality. Experimental evaluation in urban-scale simulations demonstrates that PrivLLMSwarm achieves high semantic accuracy, low encrypted inference latency, and robust formation control under privacy constraints. Comparative analysis shows PrivLLMSwarm offers a superior privacy-utility balance compared to differential privacy, federated learning, and plaintext baselines. To support reproducibility, the full implementation including source code, MPC components, and a synthetic dataset is publicly available. PrivLLMSwarm establishes a practical foundation for secure, LLM-enabled UAV swarms in privacy-sensitive IoT applications including smart-city monitoring and emergency response."

        "abstract": "Current LLM-based text anonymization frameworks usually rely on remote API services from powerful LLMs, which creates an inherent \"privacy paradox\": users must somehow disclose data to untrusted third parties for superior privacy preservation. Moreover, directly migrating these frameworks to local small-scale models (LSMs) offers a suboptimal solution with catastrophic collapse in utility based on our core findings. Our work argues that this failure stems not merely from the capability deficits of LSMs, but from the inherent irrationality of the greedy adversarial strategies employed by current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. We model the anonymization process as a trade-off between Marginal Privacy Gain (MPG) and Marginal Utility Cost (MUC), and demonstrate that greedy strategies inevitably drift into an irrational state. To address this, we propose Rational Localized Adversarial Anonymization (RLAA), a fully localized and training-free framework featuring an Attacker-Arbitrator-Anonymizer (A-A-A) architecture. RLAA introduces an arbitrator that acts as a rationality gatekeeper, validating the attacker's inference to filter out feedback providing negligible benefits on privacy preservation. This mechanism enforces a rational early-stopping criterion, and systematically prevents utility collapse. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that RLAA achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, and in some cases even outperforms SoTA on the Pareto principle. Our code and datasets will be released upon acceptance."

This paper investigates whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can enable accurate, cost-effective natural-language-to-KQL translation for enterprise security. We propose a three-knob framework targeting prompting, fine-tuning, and architecture design. First, we adapt existing NL2KQL framework for SLMs with lightweight retrieval and introduce error-aware prompting that addresses common parser failures without increasing token count. Second, we apply LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, augmenting each NLQ-KQL pair with a brief chain-of-thought explanation to transfer reasoning from a teacher model while keeping the SLM compact. Third, we propose a two-stage architecture that uses an SLM for candidate generation and a low-cost LLM judge for schema-aware refinement and selection. We evaluate nine models (five SLMs and four LLMs) across syntax correctness, semantic accuracy, table selection, and filter precision, alongside latency and token cost. On Microsoft's NL2KQL Defender Evaluation dataset, our two-stage approach achieves 0.987 syntax and 0.906 semantic accuracy. We further demonstrate generalizability on Microsoft Sentinel data, reaching 0.964 syntax and 0.831 semantic accuracy. These results come at up to 10x lower token cost than GPT-5, establishing SLMs as a practical, scalable foundation for natural-language querying in security operations."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) face critical safety challenges, as they can be manipulated to generate harmful content through adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks. Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining >= 90% refusal of harmful content."

Beyond data coverage, it establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol measuring (1) harmfulness, distinguished by a granular, multi-level scale ranging from low-impact individual harm to catastrophic societal threats, (2) intent alignment between responses and queries, and (3) response detail level, enabling nuanced safety-utility analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 open-source and 8 closed-source MLLMs to reveal their vulnerability to multi-modal jailbreak.

However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification."

We bridge this gap by introducing AGORA, a novel framework that extends 3DGS within a generative adversarial network to produce animatable avatars. Our key contribution is a lightweight, FLAME-conditioned deformation branch that predicts per-Gaussian residuals, enabling identity-preserving, fine-grained expression control while allowing real-time inference. Expression fidelity is enforced via a dual-discriminator training scheme leveraging synthetic renderings of the parametric mesh. AGORA generates avatars that are not only visually realistic but also precisely controllable. Quantitatively, we outperform state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on expression accuracy while rendering at 250+ FPS on a single GPU, and, notably, at $\\sim$9 FPS under CPU-only inference - representing, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of practical CPU-only animatable 3DGS avatar synthesis.

Recently, VC models have made rapid advancements in both generation quality and personalization capabilities. These developments have attracted considerable attention for diverse applications, including privacy preservation, voice-print reproduction for the deceased, and dysarthric speech recovery. However, these models only learn non-robust features due to the clean training data. Subsequently, it results in unsatisfactory performances when dealing with degraded input speech in real-world scenarios, including additional noise, reverberation, adversarial attacks, or even minor perturbation. Hence, it demands robust deployments, especially in real-world settings. Although latest researches attempt to find potential attacks and countermeasures for VC systems, there remains a significant gap in the comprehensive understanding of how robust the VC model is under input manipulation. here also raises many questions: For instance, to what extent do different forms of input degradation attacks alter the expected output of VC models? Is there potential for optimizing these attack and defense strategies? To answer these questions, we classify existing attack and defense methods from the perspective of input manipulation and evaluate the impact of degraded input speech across four dimensions, including intelligibility, naturalness, timbre similarity, and subjective perception.

Toward reflecting both perspectives, we propose a novel evaluation framework (PROBE), which consists of a rank transformer (RT) estimating the score of each prediction based on a required level of predictive sharpness and a rank aggregator (RA) aggregating all the scores in a popularity-aware manner. Experiments on real-world KGs reveal that existing metrics tend to over- or under-estimate the accuracy of KGC models, whereas PROBE yields a comprehensive understanding of KGC models and reliable evaluation results."

        "abstract": "Backdoor attacks embed input-dependent malicious behavior into neural networks while preserving high clean accuracy, making them a persistent threat for deployed ML systems. At the same time, real-world deployments almost never serve full-precision models: post-training quantization to INT8 or lower precision is now standard practice for reducing memory and latency. This work asks a simple question: how do existing backdoor defenses behave under standard quantization pipelines? We conduct a systematic empirical study of five representative defenses across three precision settings (FP32, INT8 dynamic, INT4 simulated) and two standard vision benchmarks using a canonical BadNet attack. We observe that INT8 quantization reduces the detection rate of all evaluated defenses to 0% while leaving attack success rates above 99%. For INT4, we find a pronounced dataset dependence: Neural Cleanse remains effective on GTSRB but fails on CIFAR-10, even though backdoors continue to survive quantization with attack success rates above 90%. Our results expose a mismatch between how defenses are commonly evaluated (on FP32 models) and how models are actually deployed (in quantized form), and they highlight quantization robustness as a necessary axis in future evaluations and designs of backdoor defenses."

Six participating teams were evaluated using a standardized FL setup and a multi-institutional dataset derived from the BraTS glioma benchmark, consisting of 1,251 training cases, 219 validation cases, and 570 hidden test cases with segmentations for enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). Teams were ranked using a cumulative scoring system that considered both segmentation performance, measured by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and communication efficiency assessed through the convergence score. A PID-controller-based method achieved the top overall ranking, obtaining mean DSC values of 0.733, 0.761, and 0.751 for ET, TC, and WT, respectively, with corresponding HD95 values of 33.922 mm, 33.623 mm, and 32.309 mm, while also demonstrating the highest communication efficiency with a convergence score of 0.764. These findings advance the state of federated learning for medical imaging, surpassing top-performing methods from previous challenge iterations and highlighting PID controllers as effective mechanisms for stabilizing and optimizing weight aggregation in FL.

FL can train various models for ITS tasks, notably camera-based Road Condition Classification (RCC), in a privacy-preserving collaborative way. However, opening up to collaboration also opens FL-based RCC systems to adversaries, i.e., misbehaving participants that can launch Targeted Label-Flipping Attacks (TLFAs) and threaten transportation safety. Adversaries mounting TLFAs poison training data to misguide model predictions, from an actual source class (e.g., wet road) to a wrongly perceived target class (e.g., dry road). Existing countermeasures against poisoning attacks cannot maintain model performance under TLFAs close to the performance level in attack-free scenarios, because they lack specific model misbehavior detection for TLFAs and neglect client exclusion after the detection. To close this research gap, we propose DEFEND, which includes a poisoned model detection strategy that leverages neuron-wise magnitude analysis for attack goal identification and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based clustering. DEFEND discards poisoned model contributions in each round and adapts accordingly client ratings, eventually excluding malicious clients. Extensive evaluation involving various FL-RCC models and tasks shows that DEFEND can thwart TLFAs and outperform seven baseline countermeasures, with at least 15.78% improvement, with DEFEND remarkably achieving under attack the same performance as in attack-free scenarios."

        "abstract": "Patch robustness certification is an emerging kind of provable defense technique against adversarial patch attacks for deep learning systems. Certified detection ensures the detection of all patched harmful versions of certified samples, which mitigates the failures of empirical defense techniques that could (easily) be compromised. However, existing certified detection methods are ineffective in certifying samples that are misclassified or whose mutants are inconsistently pre icted to different labels. This paper proposes HiCert, a novel masking-based certified detection technique. By focusing on the problem of mutants predicted with a label different from the true label with our formal analysis, HiCert formulates a novel formal relation between harmful samples generated by identified loopholes and their benign counterparts. By checking the bound of the maximum confidence among these potentially harmful (i.e., inconsistent) mutants of each benign sample, HiCert ensures that each harmful sample either has the minimum confidence among mutants that are predicted the same as the harmful sample itself below this bound, or has at least one mutant predicted with a label different from the harmful sample itself, formulated after two novel insights. As such, HiCert systematically certifies those inconsistent samples and consistent samples to a large extent. To our knowledge, HiCert is the first work capable of providing such a comprehensive patch robustness certification for certified detection. Our experiments show the high effectiveness of HiCert with a new state-of the-art performance: It certifies significantly more benign samples, including those inconsistent and consistent, and achieves significantly higher accuracy on those samples without warnings and a significantly lower false silent ratio."

        "abstract": "Iris recognition is widely recognized as one of the most accurate biometric modalities. However, its growing deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns regarding its vulnerability to Presentation Attacks (PAs). Effective Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) is therefore critical to ensure the integrity and security of iris-based biometric systems. While conventional iris recognition systems predominantly operate in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, multispectral imaging across multiple NIR bands provides complementary reflectance information that can enhance the generalizability of PAD methods. In this work, we propose \\textbf{SpectraIrisPAD}, a novel deep learning-based framework for robust multispectral iris PAD. The SpectraIrisPAD leverages a DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone equipped with learnable spectral positional encoding, token fusion, and contrastive learning to extract discriminative, band-specific features that effectively distinguish bona fide samples from various spoofing artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce a new comprehensive dataset Multispectral Iris PAD (\\textbf{MSIrPAD}) with diverse PAIs, captured using a custom-designed multispectral iris sensor operating at five distinct NIR wavelengths (800\\,nm, 830\\,nm, 850\\,nm, 870\\,nm, and 980\\,nm). The dataset includes 18,848 iris images encompassing eight diverse PAI categories, including five textured contact lenses, print attacks, and display-based attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments under unseen attack evaluation protocols to assess the generalization capability of the proposed method. SpectraIrisPAD consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across all performance metrics, demonstrating superior robustness and generalizability in detecting a wide range of presentation attacks."

        "abstract": "Incomplete data are common in real-world applications. Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used in various fields due to their powerful cross-modal comprehension and generation capabilities. However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet."

This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness."

The purpose of this work is to develop a robust sampling algorithm with fast convergence.\n  Theory and Methods: In the reverse diffusion process used for sampling the posterior, the exact likelihood is multiplied with the diffused prior at all noise scales. To overcome the issue of slow convergence, preconditioning is used. The method is trained on fastMRI data and tested on retrospectively undersampled brain data of a healthy volunteer.\n  Results: For posterior sampling in Cartesian and non-Cartesian accelerated MRI the new approach outperforms annealed sampling in terms of reconstruction speed and sample quality.\n  Conclusion: The proposed exact likelihood with preconditioning enables rapid and reliable posterior sampling across various MRI reconstruction tasks without the need for parameter tuning."

Third, using an ethical proxy for CSAM (a child wearing glasses, hereafter, CWG), we show that even when only a small percentage of child images are left in the training dataset, there exist prompting strategies that generate CWG from a child-filtered T2I model using only a few more queries than when the model is trained on the unfiltered data. Fine-tuning the filtered model on child images further reduces the additional query overhead. We also show that reintroducing a concept is possible via fine-tuning even if filtering is perfect. Our results demonstrate that current filtering methods offer limited protection to closed-weight models and no protection to open-weight models, while reducing the generality of the model by hindering the generation of child-related concepts or changing their representation. We conclude by outlining challenges in conducting evaluations that establish robust evidence on the impact of AI safety mitigations for CSAM."

Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant.

These limitations hinder reliable cross-study comparisons and create unnecessary overhead for comprehensive risk assessment. To address these gaps, we present TeleAI-Safety, a modular and reproducible framework coupled with a systematic benchmark for rigorous LLM safety evaluation. Our framework integrates a broad collection of 19 attack methods (including one self-developed method), 29 defense methods, and 19 evaluation methods (including one self-developed method). With a curated attack corpus of 342 samples spanning 12 distinct risk categories, the TeleAI-Safety benchmark conducts extensive evaluations across 14 target models. The results reveal systematic vulnerabilities and model-specific failure cases, highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and utility, and identifying potential defense patterns for future optimization. In practical scenarios, TeleAI-Safety can be flexibly adjusted with customized attack, defense, and evaluation combinations to meet specific demands.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled the increasing use of text data in causal inference, particularly for adjusting confounding factors in treatment effect estimation. Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models."

Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022).\n  In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the \"order of reasoning\" and number of agents relevant to a query is $\u03c9(\\sqrt{n})$. These results demonstrate that modest extensions to the space of expert queries dramatically strengthen the power of robust forecast aggregation. We therefore expect that our new query framework will open up a fruitful line of research in this area."

By integrating Homomorphic Encryption with gradient-based influence functions, our approach allows for the precise, blinded scoring of data points against a buyer's specific AI model. To ensure scalability for Large Language Models (LLMs), we employ low-rank gradient projections that reduce computational overhead while maintaining near-perfect fidelity to plaintext baselines, as demonstrated across BERT and GPT-2 architectures.

As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these vulnerabilities and propose multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism."

Understanding the causal factors behind such vulnerabilities is essential for building reliable defenses.\n  In this work, we introduce a unified causality analysis framework that systematically supports all levels of causal investigation in LLMs, ranging from token-level, neuron-level, and layer-level interventions to representation-level analysis. The framework enables consistent experimentation and comparison across diverse causality-based attack and defense methods. Accompanying this implementation, we provide the first comprehensive survey of causality-driven jailbreak studies and empirically evaluate the framework on multiple open-weight models and safety-critical benchmarks including jailbreaks, hallucination detection, backdoor identification, and fairness evaluation. Our results reveal that: (1) targeted interventions on causally critical components can reliably modify safety behavior; (2) safety-related mechanisms are highly localized (i.e., concentrated in early-to-middle layers with only 1--2\\% of neurons exhibiting causal influence); and (3) causal features extracted from our framework achieve over 95\\% detection accuracy across multiple threat types.\n  By bridging theoretical causality analysis and practical model safety, our framework establishes a reproducible foundation for research on causality-based attacks, interpretability, and robust attack detection and mitigation in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Amadeuszhao/SOK_Casuality."

However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications."

To evaluate robustness, we construct a synthetic dataset that incorporates atmospheric effects and diverse noise patterns, representative of realistic InSAR observations. Experiments show that the proposed model leverages the conditional prior while reducing the effect of diverse noise patterns, achieving on average a 10.11\\% reduction in NRMSE compared to SNAPHU.

To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models."

        "abstract": "Accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is fundamental to service computing, providing essential data-driven guidance for service selection and ensuring superior user experiences. However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. Such reliance not only leads to the intractability of explicit graph construction in large-scale scenarios but also limits the modeling of implicit topological relationships and exacerbates susceptibility to environmental noise and outliers. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that QoSDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the results highlight the framework's superior cross-dataset generalization capability and exceptional robustness against observational noise."

Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment.\n  In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM.

To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

Yet most existing hybrid designs omit realistic finite-key effects on QKD key rates and do not specify how to maintain security when both QKD and PQC primitives leak information through side-channels. These gaps limit the applicability of hybrid systems in practical, deployed networks. In this work, we advance a recently proposed hybrid QKD-PQC system by integrating tight finite-key security to the QKD primitive and improving the design for better scalability. This hybrid system employs an information-theoretically secure instruction sequence that determines the configurations of different primitives and thus ensures message confidentiality even when both the QKD and the PQC primitives are compromised. The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions."

        "abstract": "Security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on certifying that observed correlations arise from genuine quantum entanglement rather than eavesdropper manipulation. Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods. We provide corrected methodology using cross-distribution calibration and recommend mandatory adversarial testing for quantum security claims."

In light of the previous constraints, we introduce AutoGuard to the DevSecOps ecosystem, a reinforcement learning (RL)-powered self-healing security framework built to pre-emptively protect DevSecOps environments. AutoGuard is a self-securing security environment that continuously observes pipeline activities for potential anomalies while preemptively remediating the environment.

The RL agent improves each action over time through reward-based learning aimed at improving the agent's ability to prevent, detect and respond to a security incident in real-time. Testing using simulated ContinuousIntegration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments showed AutoGuard to successfully improve threat detection accuracy by 22%, reduce mean time torecovery (MTTR) for incidents by 38% and increase overall resilience to incidents as compared to traditional methods.\n  Keywords- DevSecOps, Reinforcement Learning, Self- Healing Security, Continuous Integration, Automated Threat Mitigation"

To ensure robustness, we propose a novel methodology for generating adversarial packages using fine-grained code obfuscation. Combining these with adversarial training (AT) enhances detector robustness by 2.5x. We comprehensively evaluate AT effectiveness by testing our detector against 122,398 packages collected daily from PyPI over 80 days, showing that AT needs careful application: it makes the detector more robust to obfuscations and allows finding 10% more obfuscated packages, but slightly decreases performance on non-obfuscated packages.\n  We demonstrate production adaptability of our detector via two case studies: (i) one for PyPI maintainers (tuned at 0.1% FPR) and (ii) one for enterprise teams (tuned at 10% FPR). In the former, we analyze 91,949 packages collected from PyPI over 37 days, achieving a daily detection rate of 2.48 malicious packages with only 2.18 false positives.

In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used.

We instead observe that modern virtualization environments exhibit weak memory isolation -- guest memory is fully attacker-controlled yet accessible from the host, providing a reliable primitive for exploitation. Based on this observation, we present the first systematic characterization and taxonomy of Cross-Domain Attacks (CDA), a class of exploitation techniques that enable capability escalation through guest memory reuse. To automate this process, we develop a system that identifies cross-domain gadgets, matches them with corrupted pointers, synthesizes triggering inputs, and assembles complete exploit chains. Our evaluation on 15 real-world vulnerabilities across QEMU and VirtualBox shows that CDA is widely applicable and effective."

We call such variants that violate learned priors about \"typical\" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations.

Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack."

The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works.

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are being introduced in a wide range of commercial applications. This has also made them prime targets of attackers who compromise their fundamental security properties, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As researchers discover novel threat vectors in UAVs, the government and industry are increasingly concerned about their limited ability to secure and regulate UAVs and their usage. With the aim of unfolding a path for a large-scale commercial UAV network deployment, we conduct a comprehensive state-of-the-art study and examine the prevailing security challenges. Unlike the prior art, we focus on uncovering the research gaps that must be addressed to enforce security policy regulations in civilian off-the-shelf drone systems. To that end, we first examine the known security threats to UAVs based on their impact and effectiveness. We then analyze existing countermeasures to prevent, detect, and respond to these threats in terms of security and performance overhead. We further outline the future research directions for securing UAVs. Finally, we establish the fundamental requirements and highlight critical research challenges in introducing a regulatory entity to achieve a secure and regulated UAV network."

        "abstract": "Cross-chain technology enables interoperability among otherwise isolated blockchains, supporting interactions across heterogeneous networks. Similar to how multi-hop communication became fundamental in the evolution of the Internet, the demand for multi-hop cross-chain interactions is gaining increasing attention. However, this growing demand introduces new security and privacy challenges. On the security side, multi-hop interactions depend on the availability of multiple participating nodes. If any node becomes temporarily offline during execution, the protocol may fail to complete correctly, leading to settlement failure or fund loss. On the privacy side, the need for on-chain transparency to validate intermediate states may unintentionally leak linkable information, compromising the unlinkability of user interactions. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN), a decentralized network designed to support secure and privacy-preserving multi-hop cross-chain transactions. Through experimental evaluation, we identify two critical types of offline failures, referred to as active and passive offline cases, which have not been adequately addressed by existing solutions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce R-HTLC, a core protocol within CCN. R-HTLC incorporates an hourglass mechanism and a multi-path refund strategy to ensure settlement correctness even when some nodes go offline during execution. Importantly, CCN addresses not only the correctness under offline conditions but also maintains unlinkability in such adversarial settings. To overcome this, CCN leverages zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain coordination, ensuring that interaction relationships remain indistinguishable even when certain nodes are temporarily offline."

        "abstract": "Adversarial perturbations are a useful way to expose vulnerabilities in object detectors. Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels."

        "abstract": "With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy."

        "abstract": "Cyber-deception is an increasingly important defensive strategy, shaping adversarial decision making through controlled misinformation, uncertainty, and misdirection. Although game-theoretic, Bayesian, Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning models offer insight into deceptive interactions, they typically assume an attacker has already chosen to engage. Such approaches overlook cognitive and perceptual factors that influence an attacker's initial decision to engage or withdraw. This paper presents a descriptive model that incorporates the psychological and strategic elements shaping this decision. The model defines five components, belief (B), scepticism (S), deception fidelity (D), reconnaissance (R), and experience (E), which interact to capture how adversaries interpret deceptive cues and assess whether continued engagement is worthwhile. The framework provides a structured method for analysing engagement decisions in cyber-deception scenarios. A series of experiments has been designed to evaluate this model through Capture the Flag activities incorporating varying levels of deception, supported by behavioural and biometric observations. These experiments have not yet been conducted, and no experimental findings are presented in this paper. These experiments will combine behavioural observations with biometric indicators to produce a multidimensional view of adversarial responses. Findings will improve understanding of the factors influencing engagement decisions and refine the model's relevance to real-world cyber-deception settings. By addressing the gap in existing models that presume engagement, this work supports more cognitively realistic and strategically effective cyber-deception practices."

The literature on adversarially robust Deep Learning attempts to either enhance the robustness of neural networks (e.g, via adversarial training) or to certify their decisions up to a given robustness level (e.g, by using randomized smoothing, formal methods or Lipschitz bounds). These studies mostly focus on classification tasks and few efficient certification procedures currently exist for semantic segmentation. In this work, we introduce a new class of certifiably robust Semantic Segmentation networks with built-in Lipschitz constraints that are efficiently trainable and achieve competitive pixel accuracy on challenging datasets such as Cityscapes. Additionally, we provide a novel framework that generalizes robustness certificates for semantic segmentation tasks, where we showcase the flexibility and computational efficiency of using Lipschitz networks. Our approach unlocks real-time compatible certifiably robust semantic segmentation for the first time. Moreover, it allows the computation of worst-case performance under $\\ell_2$ attacks of radius $\u03b5$ across a wide range of performance measures. Crucially, we benchmark the runtime of our certification process and find our approach to be around 600 times faster than randomized smoothing methods at inference with comparable certificates on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Finally, we evaluate the tightness of our worstcase certificates against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to further validate the performance of our method."

To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks.

These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members. The current third-generation scheme allows members to share group credentials, which can jeopardize group confidentiality. Our proposed scheme mitigates this risk by eliminating the ability of individual users to distribute credentials. However, a potential limitation of our scheme is its reliance on a central authority for authentication in certain scenarios."

This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines.

These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\\times$ with minor quality degradation.

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, offering superior transmission efficiency by extracting and conveying task-relevant semantic latent representations rather than raw data. However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect."

A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone."

To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques.

        "abstract": "Probabilistic seismic inverse modeling often requires the prediction of both spatially correlated geological heterogeneities (e.g., facies) and continuous parameters (e.g., rock and elastic properties). Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an efficient training-image-based simulation framework capable of reproducing complex geological models with high accuracy and comparably low generative cost. However, their application in stochastic geophysical inversion for multivariate property prediction is limited, as representing multiple coupled properties requires large and unstable networks with high memory and training demands. A more recent variant of GANs with spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN) enables the direct conditioning of facies spatial distributions on local probability maps. Leveraging on such features, an iterative geostatistical inversion algorithm is proposed, SPADE-GANInv, integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, for the prediction of facies and multiple correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The SPADE-GAN is trained to reproduce realistic facies geometries, while sequential stochastic co-simulation predicts the spatial variability of the facies-dependent continuous properties. At each iteration, a set of subsurface realizations is generated and used to compute synthetic seismic data. The realizations providing the highest similarity coefficient to the observed data are used to update the subsurface probability models in the next iteration. The method is demonstrated on both 2-D synthetic scenarios and field data, targeting the prediction of facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data. Results show that the algorithm enables accurate multivariate prediction, mitigates the impact of biased prior data, and accommodates additional local conditioning such as well logs."

To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL.

We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior."

        "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples."

We present the first comprehensive evaluation of extending these text-based MIA methods to multimodal settings. Our experiments under vision-and-text (V+T) and text-only (T-only) conditions across the DeepSeek-VL and InternVL model families show that in in-distribution settings, logit-based MIAs perform comparably across configurations, with a slight V+T advantage.

We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions."

We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes.

Across five major circuits-HTB's AI vs Humans, Cyber Apocalypse (8,129 teams), Dragos OT CTF, UWSP Pointer Overflow, and the Neurogrid CTF showdown-CAI demonstrated that Jeopardy-style CTFs have become a solved game for well-engineered AI agents. At Neurogrid, CAI captured 41/45 flags to claim the $50,000 top prize; at Dragos OT, it sprinted 37% faster to 10K points than elite human teams; even when deliberately paused mid-competition, it maintained top-tier rankings. Critically, CAI achieved this dominance through our specialized alias1 model architecture, which delivers enterprise-scale AI security operations at unprecedented cost efficiency and with augmented autonomy-reducing 1B token inference costs from $5,940 to just $119, making continuous security agent operation financially viable for the first time. These results force an uncomfortable reckoning: if autonomous agents now dominate competitions designed to identify top security talent at negligible cost, what are CTFs actually measuring? This paper presents comprehensive evidence of AI capability across the 2025 CTF circuit and argues that the security community must urgently transition from Jeopardy-style contests to Attack & Defense formats that genuinely test adaptive reasoning and resilience-capabilities that remain uniquely human, for now."

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations."

        "abstract": "Cybersecurity of space infrastructures is an emerging topic, despite space-related cybersecurity incidents occurring as early as 1977 (i.e., hijacking of a satellite transmission signal). There is no single dataset that documents cyber attacks against space infrastructures that have occurred in the past; instead, these incidents are often scattered in media reports while missing many details, which we dub the missing-data problem. Nevertheless, even ``low-quality'' datasets containing such reports would be extremely valuable because of the dearth of space cybersecurity data and the sensitivity of space infrastructures which are often restricted from disclosure by governments. This prompts a research question: How can we characterize real-world cyber attacks against space infrastructures? In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a framework, including metrics, while also addressing the missing-data problem by leveraging methodologies such as the Space Attack Research and Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) and the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) to ``extrapolate'' the missing data in a principled fashion. We show how the extrapolated data can be used to reconstruct ``hypothetical but plausible'' space cyber kill chains and space cyber attack campaigns that have occurred in practice. To show the usefulness of the framework, we extract data for 108 cyber attacks against space infrastructures and show how to extrapolate this ``low-quality'' dataset containing missing information to derive 6,206 attack technique-level space cyber kill chains. Our findings include: cyber attacks against space infrastructures are getting increasingly sophisticated; successful protection of the link segment between the space and user segments could have thwarted nearly half of the 108 attacks.

Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations."

In this work, we propose a novel SPS variant, Safeguarded SPS (SPS$_{safe}$), for the stochastic subgradient method, and provide rigorous convergence guarantees for non-smooth convex optimization with no need for strong assumptions. We further incorporate momentum into the update rule, yielding equally tight theoretical results. Comprehensive experiments on convex benchmarks and deep neural networks corroborate our theory: the proposed step size accelerates convergence, reduces variance, and consistently outperforms existing adaptive baselines.

We further analyze the impact of task-specific prompt engineering and few-shot demonstrations on solver effectiveness. We reveal that MLLMs can reliably solve recognition-oriented and low-interaction CAPTCHA tasks at human-like cost and latency, whereas tasks requiring fine-grained localization, multi-step spatial reasoning, or cross-frame consistency remain significantly harder for current models. By examining the reasoning traces of such MLLMs, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of why models succeed/fail on specific CAPTCHA puzzles and use these insights to derive defense-oriented guidelines for selecting and strengthening CAPTCHA tasks.

We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC."

Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer.

However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems."

Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis."

We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint.

Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners."

We develop an experimental framework with scripted and unscripted doctor agents, adversarial assistants, and a verifier agent that checks decisions against clinical guidelines. Using 50 representative clinical questions, we find that collusion drives the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harmful Recommendation Rates (HRR) up to 100% in unprotected systems. In contrast, the verifier agent restores 100% accuracy by blocking adversarial consensus. This work provides the first systematic evidence of collusion risk in AI healthcare and demonstrates a practical, lightweight defence that ensures guideline fidelity."

In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated."

        "abstract": "Android employs a permission framework that empowers users to either accept or deny sharing their private data (for example, location) with an app. However, many apps tend to crash when they are denied permission, leaving users no choice but to allow access to their data in order to use the app. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive and robust user data spoofing system, WhiteLie, that can spoof a variety of user data and feed it to target apps. Additionally, it detects privacy-violating behaviours, automatically responding by supplying spoofed data instead of the user's real data, without crashing or disrupting the apps. Unlike prior approaches, WhiteLie requires neither device rooting nor altering the app's binary, making it deployable on stock Android devices. Through experiments on more than 70 popular Android apps, we demonstrate that WhiteLie is able to deceive apps into accepting spoofed data without getting detected. Our evaluation further demonstrates that WhiteLie introduces negligible overhead in terms of battery usage, CPU consumption, and app execution latency. Our findings underscore the feasibility of implementing user-centric privacy-enhancing mechanisms within the existing Android ecosystem."

Existing text datasets are mainly constructed decentrally as amalgamation of assorted subsets that their data are nonfunctional and isolated to work together to cover social activities in various scenes. Also, the quality of motion data is inconsistent, and textual annotation lacks fine-grained details in these datasets. In contrast, RoleMotion is meticulously designed and collected with a particular focus on scenes and roles. The dataset features 25 classic scenes, 110 functional roles, over 500 behaviors, and 10296 high-quality human motion sequences of body and hands, annotated with 27831 fine-grained text descriptions. We build an evaluator stronger than existing counterparts, prove its reliability, and evaluate various text-to-motion methods on our dataset. Finally, we explore the interplay of motion generation of body and hands. Experimental results demonstrate the high-quality and functionality of our dataset on text-driven whole-body generation."

However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as \"(@_@)\" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems."

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies."

However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems. Through extensive experiments, our work highlights the limitations of current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems and provides a more reliable solution for real-world deployment.

This approach examines end-to-end security properties of entire systems, rather than AI models in isolation. While we recognize that hardening a single model is useful, it is important to realize that it is often insufficient. By way of an analogy, creating a model that is always helpful and harmless is akin to creating software that is always helpful and harmless. The collective experience of decades of cybersecurity research and practice shows that this is insufficient. Rather, constructing an informed and realistic attacker model before building a system, applying hard-earned lessons from software security, and continuous improvement of security posture is a tried-and-tested approach to securing real computer systems. A key goal is to examine where research challenges arise when applying traditional security principles in the context of AI agents. A secondary goal of this report is to distill these ideas for AI and ML practitioners and researchers. We discuss the challenges of applying security principles to agentic computing, present 11 case studies of real attacks on agentic systems, and define a series of new research problems specific to the security of agentic systems."

They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten."

        "abstract": "Achieving optimality and adversarial robustness in deep reinforcement learning has long been regarded as conflicting goals. Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance."

As a result, studies indicate that MLLMs are more susceptible to malicious or unsafe instructions, unlike their text-only counterparts.

Experiments on popular multi-modal jailbreak and benign datasets show that DefenSee consistently enhances MLLM robustness while better preserving performance on benign tasks compared to SOTA defenses. It reduces the ASR of jailbreak attacks to below 1.70% on MiniGPT4 using the MM-SafetyBench benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods under the same conditions."

        "abstract": "Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(\u0394t) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(\u0394t^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates."

Traditional methods often employ pre-trained models that struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to difficulties in aligning with complex or ambiguous moments. To overcome these limitations, we explore Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to construct a vanilla Evidential baseline. However, this approach encounters two major issues: the inability to effectively handle modality imbalance and the structural differences in DER's heuristic uncertainty regularizer, which adversely affect uncertainty estimation. This misalignment results in high uncertainty being incorrectly associated with accurate samples rather than challenging ones. Our observations indicate that existing methods lack the adaptability required for complex video scenarios. In response, we propose Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR), a novel framework that incorporates a Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment and a query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, thereby reducing bias in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we introduce a Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions, enabling adaptive alignment with difficult moments and improving retrieval accuracy. Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD demonstrates significant enhancements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability, positioning our approach as a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval.

We then systematically evaluate a hierarchy of models, progressing from classical baselines (SARIMA, Prophet) to machine learning (XGBoost) and advanced deep learning architectures (LSTM). Our findings reveal that classical models fail to capture the data's non-linear, regime-switching behavior. While the LSTM provided the most well-calibrated probabilistic forecast, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) emerged as the superior all-round model, achieving the best point forecast accuracy (RMSE 481.94) and producing safer, more cautious prediction intervals that effectively capture extreme volatility."

We demonstrate that these adversarial passages, though linguistically coherent and truthful, can systematically crowd out opposing views from the retrieved context and steer LLM answers toward the attacker's intended perspective.\n  We precisely characterize this class of attacks and then develop a post-retrieval filtering defense, BiasDef. We construct a comprehensive benchmark based on public question answering datasets to evaluate them. Our results show that: (1) the proposed attack induces significant perspective shifts in LLM answers, effectively evading existing retrieval-based sanitization defenses; and (2) BiasDef outperforms existing methods by reducing adversarial passages retrieved by 15\\% which mitigates perspective shift by 6.2\\times in answers, while enabling the retrieval of 62\\% more benign passages."

        "abstract": "Intelligent driving systems are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs. These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances."

Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing \"cat\" with \"dog\"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures and datasets show that both CTP and CGUB achieve high attack success rates while maintaining moderate impact on clean-task performance. These findings highlight concept-level vulnerabilities as a critical new attack surface for VLMs."

High expressivity required for robust privacy induces exponentially large dynamical Lie algebras. This structure inevitably leads to barren plateaus. Conversely, trainable models restricted to polynomial-sized algebras remain transparent to algebraic attacks. To resolve this impasse, DyLoC is proposed. This dual-layer architecture employs an orthogonal decoupling strategy. Trainability is anchored to a polynomial-DLA ansatz while privacy is externalized to the input and output interfaces. Specifically, Truncated Chebyshev Graph Encoding (TCGE) is employed to thwart snapshot inversion. Dynamic Local Scrambling (DLS) is utilized to obfuscate gradients. Experiments demonstrate that DyLoC maintains baseline-level convergence with a final loss of 0.186. It outperforms the baseline by increasing the gradient reconstruction error by 13 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, snapshot inversion attacks are blocked when the reconstruction mean squared error exceeds 2.0. These results confirm that DyLoC effectively establishes a verifiable pathway for secure and trainable quantum machine learning."

However, existing correlation methods suffer from two major limitations: limited robustness to noise and partial observations, and poor scalability due to computationally expensive pairwise matching. To address these challenges, we propose RECTor, a machine learning-based framework for traffic correlation under realistic conditions. RECTor employs attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and GRU-based temporal encoding to extract robust flow representations, even when traffic data is incomplete or obfuscated. These embeddings are mapped into a shared space via a Siamese network and efficiently matched using approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search. Empirical evaluations show that RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCorr, DeepCOFFEA, and FlowTracker, achieving up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reducing training and inference time by over 50%. Moreover, RECTor demonstrates strong scalability: inference cost grows near-linearly as the number of flows increases. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Tor's anonymity model and highlight the need for advanced model-aware defenses."

We introduce Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion (POLARIS), which reformulates inversion from an error-compensation problem into an error-origin problem. Rather than optimizing embeddings or latent codes to offset accumulated drift, POLARIS treats the guidance scale \u03c9 as a step-wise variable and derives a mathematically grounded formula to minimize inversion error at each step. Remarkably, POLARIS improves inversion latent quality with just one line of code. With negligible performance overhead, it substantially mitigates noise approximation errors and consistently improves the accuracy of downstream tasks."

An information-theoretic lower bound is developed to confirm the tightness of our algorithm's sample complexity, which is optimal regarding both state and action spaces.

However, small perturbations in the model input can significantly change the predictions. Adversarial attacks are used to identify small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications. More powerful black-box adversarial attacks are required to develop more effective defenses. A promising approach to black-box adversarial attacks is to repeat the process of extracting a specific image area and changing the perturbations added to it. Existing attacks adopt simple rectangles as the areas where perturbations are changed in a single iteration. We propose applying superpixels instead, which achieve a good balance between color variance and compactness. We also propose a new search method, versatile search, and a novel attack method, Superpixel Attack, which applies superpixels and performs versatile search. Superpixel Attack improves attack success rates by an average of 2.10% compared with existing attacks.

        "abstract": "Signed graphs with positive and negative edges can model complex relationships in social networks. Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks."

        "abstract": "Approximate machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, offering a practical alternative to full retraining. However, it introduces privacy risks: an adversary with access to pre- and post-unlearning models can exploit their differences for membership inference or data reconstruction. We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data. These results highlight teleportation as a general tool for reducing attack success in approximate unlearning."

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments."

To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters."

Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients.\n  We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size.

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking."

Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments."

For this reason, security-oriented disciplines of signal processing have received increasing attention in the last decades: multimedia forensics, digital watermarking, biometrics, network monitoring, steganography and steganalysis are just a few examples. Even though each of these fields has its own peculiarities, they all have to deal with a common problem: the presence of one or more adversaries aiming at making the system fail. Adversarial Signal Processing lays the basis of a general theory that takes into account the impact that the presence of an adversary has on the design of effective signal processing tools. By focusing on the application side of Adversarial Signal Processing, namely adversarial information fusion in distributed sensor networks, and adopting a game-theoretic approach, this thesis contributes to the above mission by addressing four issues. First, we address decision fusion in distributed sensor networks by developing a novel soft isolation defense scheme that protect the network from adversaries, specifically, Byzantines. Second, we develop an optimum decision fusion strategy in the presence of Byzantines. In the next step, we propose a technique to reduce the complexity of the optimum fusion by relying on a novel near-optimum message passing algorithm based on factor graphs.

The proposed solution reduces positioning errors by up to 41% relative to standard FGO, and achieves even larger improvements over extended Kalman filter (EKF) baselines in urban canyon environments. These results highlight the benefits of Barron loss in enhancing the resilience of GNSS/IMU-based navigation in urban and signal-compromised environments."

In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery. We demonstrate that ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images. The code and pretrained models will be released upon publication."

First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks.

In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone."

However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving."

In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities. Furthermore, we show that our method improves visual robustness, lowering target confusion by 6%, and enhances safety by reducing collision rate by 7%."

We present NetDeTox, an automated end-to-end framework that orchestrates large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) in a systematic manner, enabling focused local rewriting. The RL agent identifies netlist components critical for GNN-based reasoning, while the LLM devises rewriting plans to diversify motifs that preserve functionality. Iterative feedback between the RL and LLM stages refines adversarial rewritings to limit overheads. Compared to the SOTA work AttackGNN, NetDeTox successfully degrades the effectiveness of all security schemes with fewer rewrites and substantially lower area overheads (reductions of 54.50% for GNN-RE, 25.44% for GNN4IP, and 41.04% for OMLA, respectively). For GNN4IP, ours can even optimize/reduce the original benchmarks' area, in particular for larger circuits, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of NetDeTox."

Unlike traditional GANs, where the generator learns an arbitrary transport plan between the noise and the data distributions, our generator learns a deterministic noise-to-data mapping, which is the same optimal transport as in flow-matching models. This significantly stabilizes adversarial training. Also, unlike consistency-based methods, our model directly learns one-step or few-step generation without needing to learn the intermediate timesteps of the probability flow for propagation. This saves model capacity, reduces training iterations, and avoids error accumulation. Under the same 1NFE setting on ImageNet-256px, our B/2 model approaches the performance of consistency-based XL/2 models, while our XL/2 model creates a new best FID of 2.38.

We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection."

Existing instantiations, however, typically rely on classical signature schemes whose long-term security is threatened by quantum-capable adversaries. In this paper we formalize security notions for evidence structures in the presence of quantum adversaries and study post-quantum (PQ) instantiations and migration strategies for deployed audit logs. We recall an abstraction of constant-size evidence structures and introduce game-based definitions of Q-Audit Integrity, Q-Non-Equivocation, and Q-Binding, capturing the inability of a quantum adversary to forge, equivocate, or rebind evidence items. We then analyze a hash-and-sign instantiation in the quantum random-oracle model (QROM), assuming an existentially unforgeable PQ signature scheme against quantum adversaries, and show that the resulting evidence structure satisfies these notions under standard assumptions. Building on this, we present three migration patterns for existing evidence logs: hybrid signatures, re-signing of legacy evidence, and Merkle-root anchoring, and analyze their security, storage, and computational trade-offs. A case study based on an industrial constant-size evidence platform for regulated AI at Codebat Technologies Inc. suggests that quantum-safe audit trails are achievable with moderate overhead and that systematic migration can significantly extend the evidentiary lifetime of existing deployments."

While essential, the centralized nature of the Sequencer makes it vulnerable to attacks, such as censorship, transaction manipulation and tampering. To enhance its security, there are solutions in the literature that shield the Sequencer inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

        "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy."

To address this problem, organizations rely on security awareness programs, which aim to make employees more resilient against social engineering. While some works have suggested that such programs should account for contextual relevance, the common praxis in research is to adopt a \"general\" viewpoint. For instance, instead of focusing on department-specific issues, prior user studies sought to provide organization-wide conclusions. Such a protocol may lead to overlooking vulnerabilities that affect only specific subsets of an organization.\n  In this paper, we tackle such an oversight. First, through a systematic literature review, we provide evidence that prior literature poorly accounted for department-specific needs. Then, we carry out a multi-company and mixed-methods study focusing on two pivotal departments: human resources (HR) and accounting. We explore three dimensions: threats faced by these departments; topics covered in the security-awareness campaigns delivered to these departments; and delivery methods that maximize the effectiveness of such campaigns. We begin by interviewing 16 employees of a multinational enterprise, and then use these results as a scaffold to design a structured survey through which we collect the responses of over 90 HR/accounting members of 9 organizations. We find that HR is targeted through job applications containing malware and executive impersonation, while accounting is exposed to invoice fraud, credential theft, and ransomware. Current training is often viewed as too generic, with employees preferring shorter, scenario-based formats like videos and simulations. These preferences contradict the common industry practice of annual sessions. Based on these insights, we propose recommendations for designing awareness programs tailored to departmental needs and workflows."

Model compression addresses this challenge, with low-rank factorization emerging as a particularly effective method for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression. Beyond compression, we investigate how model scale and fine-tuning affect trustworthiness, as both are important in low-rank methods. To guide trustworthy compression strategies, we end our paper with a gradient-based attribution analysis to identify which layers in LLMs contribute most to adversarial robustness."

        "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) safety guardrail models have emerged as a primary defense mechanism against harmful content generation, yet their robustness against sophisticated adversarial attacks remains poorly characterized. This study evaluated ten publicly available guardrail models from Meta, Google, IBM, NVIDIA, Alibaba, and Allen AI across 1,445 test prompts spanning 21 attack categories. While Qwen3Guard-8B achieved the highest overall accuracy (85.3%, 95% CI: 83.4-87.1%), a critical finding emerged when separating public benchmark prompts from novel attacks: all models showed substantial performance degradation on unseen prompts, with Qwen3Guard dropping from 91.0% to 33.8% (a 57.2 percentage point gap). In contrast, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B showed the best generalization with only a 6.5% gap. A \"helpful mode\" jailbreak was also discovered where two guardrail models (Nemotron-Safety-8B, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B) generated harmful content instead of blocking it, representing a novel failure mode. These findings suggest that benchmark performance may be misleading due to training data contamination, and that generalization ability, not overall accuracy, should be the primary metric for guardrail evaluation."
