        "abstract": "Multi-behavior recommendation faces a critical challenge in practice: auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, carts) are often noisy, weakly correlated, or semantically misaligned with the target behavior (e.g., purchase), which leads to biased preference learning and suboptimal performance. While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.\n  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations.

        "abstract": "The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm promises scalable rubric-based evaluation, yet aligning frozen black-box models with human standards remains a challenge due to inherent generation stochasticity. We reframe judge alignment as a criteria transfer problem and isolate three recurrent failure modes: rubric instability caused by prompt sensitivity, unverifiable reasoning that lacks auditable evidence, and scale misalignment with human grading boundaries. To address these issues, we introduce RULERS (Rubric Unification, Locking, and Evidence-anchored Robust Scoring), a compiler-executor framework that transforms natural language rubrics into executable specifications. RULERS operates by compiling criteria into versioned immutable bundles, enforcing structured decoding with deterministic evidence verification, and applying lightweight Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, all without updating model parameters. Extensive experiments on essay and summarization benchmarks demonstrate that RULERS significantly outperforms representative baselines in human agreement, maintains strong stability against adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to rival larger proprietary judges. Overall, our results suggest that reliable LLM judging requires executable rubrics, verifiable evidence, and calibrated scales rather than prompt phrasing alone.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08623v1",
        "abstract": "Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08618v1",
        "abstract": "Multiple binary responses arise in many modern data-analytic problems. Although fitting separate logistic regressions for each response is computationally attractive, it ignores shared structure and can be statistically inefficient, especially in high-dimensional and class-imbalanced regimes. Low-rank models offer a natural way to encode latent dependence across tasks, but existing methods for binary data are largely likelihood-based and focus on pointwise classification rather than ranking performance. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure. We develop a scalable projected gradient descent algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition. Exploiting the fact that the pairwise loss depends only on differences of linear predictors, we simplify computation and analysis. We establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, showing that under suitable regularity conditions, leading to linear convergence up to the minimax-optimal statistical precision. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust in challenging settings such as label switching and data contamination and consistently outperforms likelihood-based approaches."

This sophisticated method leverages DRL methodology not only to execute precise and detrimental impacts on targeted infrastructure but also to evade detection by contemporary AI-driven defence systems. By developing and implementing tailored policies, the attackers ensure their hostile actions blend seamlessly with normal operational patterns, circumventing integrated security measures.

        "abstract": "Objectives: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage with extensive peritoneal metastases, making treatment challenging. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83. Omental lesions provided the best results for CRS prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for DiaR (AUC 0.76). Conclusion: The integration of robustness into the feature selection processes ensures the development of reliable models and thus facilitates the implementation of the radiomics models in clinical applications for HGSOC patients. Future work should explore further applications of radiomics in ovarian cancer, particularly in real-time clinical settings."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08446v1",
        "abstract": "The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC."

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis."

Operating within the emerging UAS Traffic Management (UTM) framework, these lightweight and highly networked platforms depend on secure communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) subsystems that are vulnerable to spoofing, jamming, hijacking, and data manipulation. While prior reviews of UAS security addressed these challenges at a conceptual level, a detailed, system-oriented analysis for resource-constrained sUAS remains lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of cyber-security vulnerabilities and defenses tailored to the sUAS and UTM ecosystem. We organize existing research across the full cyber-physical stack, encompassing CNS, data links, sensing and perception, UTM cloud access, and software integrity layers, and classify attack vectors according to their technical targets and operational impacts. Correspondingly, we review defense mechanisms ranging from classical encryption and authentication to adaptive intrusion detection, lightweight cryptography, and secure firmware management. By mapping threats to mitigation strategies and evaluating their scalability and practical effectiveness, this work establishes a unified taxonomy and identifies open challenges for achieving safe, secure, and scalable sUAS operations within future UTM environments."

Firstly, dimensionality is reduced through illumination equalization and structural information extraction. A coarse-to-fine candidate selection strategy minimizes sliding window computational costs, enabling rapid estimation of the marker's position. Finally, adaptive templates are generated for candidate points, achieving subpixel precision through improved template matching with correlation coefficient extremum fitting. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in extracting and localizing diagonal markers in complex, large-scale environments, making it ideal for field-of-view measurement in navigation tasks."

Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation.

While high-quality data is often preferred for training, real-world inputs are frequently affected by noise and other distortions. This paper investigates the effect of deliberately introducing controlled noise into the training data to improve model robustness. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience."

        "abstract": "Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the CREATE-IF-LATE (CIL) algorithm, which is a fully decentralized, resilient mechanism that enables self-creating RWs and prevents RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis shows that the CIL algorithm guarantees several desirable properties, such as (i) non-extinction of the RW population, (ii) almost sure boundedness of the RW population, and (iii) convergence of RW-based stochastic gradient descent even in the presence of Pac-Man with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Moreover, the learning process experiences at most a linear time delay due to Pac-Man interruptions and RW regeneration. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and public benchmark datasets validate our theoretical findings."

CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability.

Cloud-based intrusion detection systems add latency that is unsuitable for real-time control, while CPU-bound firewalls and generic SDN controllers lack MQTT awareness to enforce session validation, topic-based authorization, and behavioral anomaly detection. We propose a P4-based data-plane enforcement scheme for protocol-aware MQTT security and anomaly detection at the network edge. The design combines parser-safe MQTT header extraction with session-order validation, byte-level topic-prefix authorization with per-client rate limiting and soft-cap enforcement, and lightweight anomaly detection based on KeepAlive and Remaining Length screening with clone-to-CPU diagnostics. The scheme leverages stateful primitives in BMv2 (registers, meters, direct counters) to enable runtime policy adaptation with minimal per-packet latency. Experiments on a Mininet/BMv2 testbed demonstrate high policy enforcement accuracy (99.8%, within 95% CI), strong anomaly detection sensitivity (98\\% true-positive rate), and high delivery >99.9% for 100--5~kpps; 99.8% at 10~kpps; 99.6\\% at 16~kpps) with sub-millisecond per-packet latency. These results show that protocol-aware MQTT filtering can be efficiently realized in the programmable data plane, providing a practical foundation for edge IoT security.

The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem. We reported the details of this attack to the framework developers and received acknowledgment before submission."

        "abstract": "Stable Diffusion (SD) often produces degraded outputs when the training dataset contains adversarial noise. Adversarial purification offers a promising solution by removing adversarial noise from contaminated data. However, existing purification methods are primarily designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies, such as attacks targeting the VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both. To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak. UDAP also generalizes well across SD versions and text prompts, showcasing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios."

When adversarial instructions appear in user queries or externally retrieved content, models may override intended logic. Recent defenses rely on supervised fine-tuning with benign and malicious labels. Although these methods achieve high attack rejection rates, we find that they rely on narrow correlations in defense data rather than harmful intent, leading to systematic rejection of safe inputs. We analyze three recurring shortcut behaviors induced by defense fine-tuning. \\emph{Position bias} arises when benign content placed later in a prompt is rejected at much higher rates; across reasoning benchmarks, suffix-task rejection rises from below \\textbf{10\\%} to as high as \\textbf{90\\%}. \\emph{Token trigger bias} occurs when strings common in attack data raise rejection probability even in benign contexts; inserting a single trigger token increases false refusals by up to \\textbf{50\\%}. \\emph{Topic generalization bias} reflects poor generalization beyond the defense data distribution, with defended models suffering test-time accuracy drops of up to \\textbf{40\\%}. These findings suggest that current prompt-injection defenses frequently respond to attack-like surface patterns rather than the underlying intent. We introduce controlled diagnostic datasets and a systematic evaluation across two base models and multiple defense pipelines, highlighting limitations of supervised fine-tuning for reliable LLM security."

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining. To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a robust LLM-RL framework with HITL support for cloud defense. We will release our framework to the community, facilitating the advancement of robust and autonomous defense in cloud networks."

We develop a robust GP-based BO via tempered posterior updates, which downweight the likelihood by a power $\u03b1\\in (0,1]$ to mitigate overconfidence under local misspecification. We establish cumulative regret bounds for tempered BO under a family of generalized improvement rules, including EI, and show that tempering yields strictly sharper worst-case regret guarantees than the standard posterior $(\u03b1=1)$, with the most favorable guarantees occurring near the classical EI choice.\n  Motivated by our theoretic findings, we propose a prequential procedure for selecting $\u03b1$ online: it decreases $\u03b1$ when realized prediction errors exceed model-implied uncertainty and returns $\u03b1$ toward one as calibration improves. Empirical results demonstrate that tempering provides a practical yet theoretically grounded tool for stabilizing BO surrogates under localized sampling."

To enable fair comparison, we evaluate all methods under consistent conditions, jointly assessing security and functionality using multiple analyzers and executable tests. Our findings reveal critical robustness gaps: static analyzers overestimate security by 7 to 21 times, with 37 to 60% of ``secure'' outputs being non-functional. Under adversarial conditions, true secure-and-functional rates collapse to 3 to 17%.

Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales. Experiments on the Brain and MDC datasets demonstrate that our attacks significantly degrade classification performance, especially in tumor regions, while remaining visually imperceptible.

Answering basic ISPM visibility questions, such as understanding identity inventory and configuration hygiene, requires interpreting complex identity data, motivating growing interest in agentic AI systems. Despite this interest, there is currently no standardized way to evaluate how well such systems perform ISPM visibility tasks on real enterprise data. We introduce the Sola Visibility ISPM Benchmark, the first benchmark designed to evaluate agentic AI systems on foundational ISPM visibility tasks using a live, production-grade identity environment spanning AWS, Okta, and Google Workspace. The benchmark focuses on identity inventory and hygiene questions and is accompanied by the Sola AI Agent, a tool-using agent that translates natural-language queries into executable data exploration steps and produces verifiable, evidence-backed answers. Across 77 benchmark questions, the agent achieves strong overall performance, with an expert accuracy of 0.84 and a strict success rate of 0.77. Performance is highest on AWS hygiene tasks, where expert accuracy reaches 0.94, while results on Google Workspace and Okta hygiene tasks are more moderate, yet competitive. Overall, this work provides a practical and reproducible benchmark for evaluating agentic AI systems in identity security and establishes a foundation for future ISPM benchmarks covering more advanced identity analysis and governance tasks."

The review identifies 24 influence factors grouped into six main categories: demographic factors, personality traits, psychological factors, policy and values, media consumption, and preventive factors. Key findings highlight that lower education levels, high extraversion, low agreeableness, high neuroticism, and low cognitive reflection significantly increase belief in false information. The effectiveness of preventive strategies like labeling false information and promoting reflection about correctness is also discussed. This literature review conceptualizes belief in false information as a human-centered security risk in sociotechnical systems, as it can be exploited to manipulate decisions, undermine trust, and increase susceptibility to social engineering.

A critical assumption in existing approaches is that the data requested for unlearning are selected i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed). However,the problem of certified unlearning under non-i.i.d. deletions remains largely unexplored. In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets. We then propose a better certified unlearning approach by performing a distribution-aware certified unlearning framework based on iterative Newton updates constrained by a trust region. Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning. To demonstrate its practical effectiveness under distribution shift, we also conduct extensive experiments across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a comprehensive assessment of our approach."

The system models execution-time behaviors of OSS packages as lightweight heterogeneous graphs and applies attention-based graph learning to rank behavioral patterns that are most relevant for security analysis. Rather than aiming for fully automated detection, HeteroGAT-Rank surfaces actionable runtime signals - such as file, network, and command activities - to guide manual investigation and threat hunting. To operate at ecosystem scale, the system decouples offline behavior mining from online analysis and integrates parallel graph construction for efficient processing across multiple ecosystems. An evaluation on a large-scale OSS execution dataset shows that HeteroGAT-Rank effectively highlights meaningful and interpretable behavioral indicators aligned with real-world vulnerability and attack trends, supporting practical security workflows under realistic operational constraints."

Despite being trained on large-scale, high-quality data, LLMs still fail to outperform traditional static analysis tools in specialized domains like smart contract vulnerability detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training algorithm based on atomic task decomposition and fusion. This algorithm aims to achieve combinatorial generalization under limited data by decomposing complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, we decompose the reentrancy vulnerability detection task into four linearly independent atomic tasks: identifying external calls, identifying state updates, identifying data dependencies between external calls and state updates, and determining their data flow order. These tasks form the core components of our approach. By training on synthetic datasets, we generate three compiler-verified datasets. We then employ the Slither tool to extract structural information from the control flow graph and data flow graph, which is used to fine-tune the LLM's adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that low-rank normalization fusion with the LoRA adapter improves the LLM's reentrancy vulnerability detection accuracy to 98.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. On 31 real-world contracts, the algorithm achieves a 20% higher recall than traditional analysis tools."

However, a few methods predominantly focus on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two typical components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness of depth priors empowers the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, such as 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on the SOTS dataset, 1.19 dB on the Haze4K dataset and 1.79 dB PSNR on the NHR dataset.

PAA leverages in-context learning, using previous paraphrases and their scores to guide candidate generation. Experiments across five ML and NLP conferences with three LLM reviewers and five attacking models show that PAA consistently increases review scores without changing the paper's claims. Human evaluation confirms that generated paraphrases maintain meaning and naturalness. We also find that attacked papers exhibit increased perplexity in reviews, offering a potential detection signal, and that paraphrasing submissions can partially mitigate attacks."

Unfortunately, existing MIA defenses, typically applied independently to each client in FL, are ineffective against powerful trajectory-based MIAs that exploit temporal information throughout the training process to infer membership status. In this paper, we investigate a new FL defense scenario driven by heterogeneous privacy needs and privacy-utility trade-offs, where only a subset of clients are defended, as well as a collaborative defense mode where clients cooperate to mitigate membership privacy leakage. To this end, we introduce CoFedMID, a collaborative defense framework against MIAs in FL, which limits local model memorization of training samples and, through a defender coalition, enhances privacy protection and model utility. Specifically, CoFedMID consists of three modules: a class-guided partition module for selective local training samples, a utility-aware compensation module to recycle contributive samples and prevent their overconfidence, and an aggregation-neutral perturbation module that injects noise for cancellation at the coalition level into client updates. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our defense framework significantly reduces the performance of seven MIAs while incurring only a small utility loss. These results are consistently verified across various defense settings."

This paper introduces BiasLab, an open-source, model-agnostic evaluation framework for quantifying output-level (extrinsic) bias through a multilingual, robustness-oriented experimental design. BiasLab constructs mirrored probe pairs under a strict dual-framing scheme: an affirmative assertion favoring Target A and a reverse assertion obtained by deterministic target substitution favoring Target B, while preserving identical linguistic structure. To reduce dependence on prompt templates, BiasLab performs repeated evaluation under randomized instructional wrappers and enforces a fixed-choice Likert response format to maximize comparability across models and languages. Responses are normalized into agreement labels using an LLM-based judge, aligned for polarity consistency across framings, and aggregated into quantitative bias indicators with descriptive statistics including effect sizes and neutrality rates. The framework supports evaluation across diverse bias axes, including demographic, cultural, political, and geopolitical topics, and produces reproducible artifacts such as structured reports and comparative visualizations. BiasLab contributes a standardized methodology for cross-lingual and framing-sensitive bias measurement that complements intrinsic and dataset-based audits, enabling researchers and institutions to benchmark robustness and make better-informed deployment decisions."

A central question in this area is how predictions can improve performance, and a key aspect of this analysis is the role of prediction accuracy. In this context, prediction accuracy is defined as a guaranteed probability that an instance drawn from the distribution belongs to the predicted set. As a performance measure that incorporates prediction accuracy, we focus on the distributionally-robust competitive ratio (DRCR), introduced by Sun et al.~(ICML 2024). The DRCR is defined as the expected ratio between the algorithm's cost and the optimal cost, where the expectation is taken over the worst-case instance distribution that satisfies the given prediction and accuracy requirement. A known structural property is that, for any fixed algorithm, the DRCR decreases linearly as prediction accuracy increases. Building on this result, we establish that the optimal DRCR value (i.e., the infimum over all algorithms) is a monotone and concave function of prediction accuracy. We further generalize the DRCR framework to a multiple-prediction setting and show that monotonicity and concavity are preserved in this setting. Finally, we apply our results to the ski rental problem, a benchmark problem in online optimization, to identify the conditions on prediction accuracies required for the optimal DRCR to attain a target value. Moreover, we provide a method for computing the critical accuracy, defined as the minimum accuracy required for the optimal DRCR to strictly improve upon the performance attainable without any accuracy guarantee."

Despite recent progress, existing frameworks still fall short of practical model scales, with gaps up to a hundredfold. A possible way to close this gap is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has emerged as a promising technique to scale up model capacity with minimal overhead. However, given that the current secure two-party (2-PC) protocols allow the server to homomorphically compute the FFN layer with its plaintext model weight, under the MoE setting, this could reveal which expert is activated to the server, exposing token-level privacy about the client's input. While naively evaluating all the experts before selection could protect privacy, it nullifies MoE sparsity and incurs the heavy computational overhead that sparse MoE seeks to avoid. To address the privacy and efficiency limitations above, we propose a 2-PC privacy-preserving inference framework, \\SecMoE. Unifying per-entry circuits in both the MoE layer and piecewise polynomial functions, \\SecMoE obliviously selects the extracted parameters from circuits and only computes one encrypted entry, which we refer to as Select-Then-Compute. This makes the model for private inference scale to 63$\\times$ larger while only having a 15.2$\\times$ increase in end-to-end runtime.

        "abstract": "Phishing with Quick Response (QR) codes is termed as Quishing. The attackers exploit this method to manipulate individuals into revealing their confidential data. Recently, we see the colorful and fancy representations of QR codes, the 2D matrix of QR codes which does not reflect a typical mixture of black-white modules anymore. Instead, they become more tempting as an attack vector for adversaries which can evade the state-of-the-art deep learning visual-based and other prevailing countermeasures. We introduce \"ALFA\", a safe-by-design approach, to mitigate Quishing and prevent everyone from accessing the post-scan harmful payload of fancy QR codes. Our method first converts a fancy QR code into the replica of binary grid and then identify the erroneous representation of modules in that grid. Following that, we present \"FAST\" method which can conveniently recover erroneous modules from that binary grid. Afterwards, using this binary grid, our solution extracts the structural features of fancy QR code and predicts its legitimacy using a pre-trained model. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset (containing diverse variations of fancy QR codes) and achieve a FNR of 0.06% only. We also develop the mobile app to test the practical feasibility of our solution and provide a performance comparison of the app with the real-world QR readers. This comparison further highlights the classification reliability and detection accuracy of this solution in real-world environments."

        "abstract": "Membership inference attack (MIA) poses a significant privacy threat in federated learning (FL) as it allows adversaries to determine whether a client's private dataset contains a specific data sample. While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings."

Existing watermarking methods (1) remain vulnerable to real-world adversarial threats, often forced to trade off between defenses against spoofing and removal attacks; and (2) cannot support semantic-level tamper localization. We introduce PAI, a training-free inherent watermarking framework for AIGC copyright protection, plug-and-play with diffusion-based AIGC services. PAI simultaneously provides three key functionalities: robust ownership verification, attack detection, and semantic-level tampering localization. Unlike existing inherent watermark methods that only embed watermarks at noise initialization of diffusion models, we design a novel key-conditioned deflection mechanism that subtly steers the denoising trajectory according to the user key. Such trajectory-level coupling further strengthens the semantic entanglement of identity and content, thereby further enhancing robustness against real-world threats. Moreover, we also provide a theoretical analysis proving that only the valid key can pass verification. Experiments across 12 attack methods show that PAI achieves 98.43\\% verification accuracy, improving over SOTA methods by 37.25\\% on average, and retains strong tampering localization performance even against advanced AIGC edits.

        "abstract": "This study presents a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture (SMTA) combined with a novel concept Burn-After-Use (BAU) mechanism for enterprise LLM environments to effectively prevent data leakage. As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs."

When data traverses borders, it becomes subject to conflicting legal regimes, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law, compounded by technical vulnerabilities like model memorization. Current static encryption and data localization methods are fragmented and reactive, failing to provide adequate, policy-aligned safeguards. This research proposes a Jurisdiction-Aware, Privacy-by-Design architecture that dynamically integrates localized encryption, adaptive differential privacy, and real-time compliance assertion via cryptographic proofs. Empirical validation in a multi-jurisdictional simulation demonstrates this architecture reduced unauthorized data exposure to below five percent and achieved zero compliance violations. These security gains were realized while maintaining model utility retention above ninety percent and limiting computational overhead. This establishes that proactive, integrated controls are feasible for secure and globally compliant AI deployment."

        "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) training often optimizes for preference alignment, rewarding outputs that are perceived as helpful and interaction-friendly. However, this preference-oriented objective can be exploited: manipulative prompts can steer responses toward user-appeasing agreement and away from truth-oriented correction. In this work, we investigate whether aligned models are vulnerable to Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA), a class of manipulative prompting strategies designed to exploit the model's desire to please user preferences at the expense of truthfulness. We propose a diagnostic methodology that provides a finer-grained and more directive analysis than aggregate benchmark scores, using a factorial evaluation framework to decompose prompt-induced shifts into interpretable effects of system objectives (truth- vs. preference-oriented) and PUA-style dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial) within a controlled $2 \\times 2^4$ design. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulative prompts. Beyond the dominant reality-denial factor, we observe model-specific sign reversals and interactions with PUA-style factors, suggesting tailored defenses rather than uniform robustness. These findings offer a novel, reproducible factorial evaluation methodology that provides finer-grained diagnostics for post-training processes like RLHF, enabling better trade-offs in the product iteration of LLMs by offering a more nuanced understanding of preference alignment risks and the impact of manipulative prompts."

In a HEP classification task, we show that a soft symmetry respecting inductive bias creates approximate degeneracies in the loss, which we identify as pseudo-Goldstone modes. We quantify functional complexity using metrics derived from first principles Hessian analysis and via compressibility.

        "abstract": "FIDO2 and the WebAuthn standard offer phishing-resistant, public-key based authentication but traditionally rely on device-bound cryptographic keys that are not naturally portable across user devices. Recent passkey deployments address this limitation by enabling multi-device credentials synchronized via platform-specific cloud ecosystems. However, these approaches require users and organizations to trust the corresponding cloud or phone providers with the protection and availability of their authentication material. In parallel, qualified electronic signature (QES) tokens and smart-card--based PKCS#11 modules provide high-assurance, hardware-rooted identity, yet they are not directly compatible with WebAuthn flows.\n  This paper explores architectural options for bridging these technologies by securing a virtual FIDO2 authenticator with a QES-grade PKCS#11 key and enabling encrypted cloud synchronization of FIDO2 private keys. We first present and implement a baseline architecture in which the cloud stores only ciphertext and the decryption capability remains anchored exclusively in the user's hardware token. We then propose a hardened variant that introduces an Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF)-based mechanism bound to a local user-verification factor, thereby mitigating cross-protocol misuse and ensuring that synchronization keys cannot be repurposed outside the intended FIDO2 semantics; this enhanced design is analyzed but not implemented. Both architectures preserve a pure WebAuthn/FIDO2 interface to relying parties while offering different trust and deployment trade-offs. We provide the system model, threat analysis, implementation of the baseline architecture, and experimental evaluation, followed by a discussion of the hardened variant's security implications for high-assurance authentication deployments."

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) have focused heavily on Diffusion Probabilistic Models, which achieve high perceptual quality but suffer from significant computational latency (often exceeding 2-4 seconds per image). Conversely, traditional CNN-based baselines offer real-time inference but struggle with \"over-smoothing,\" failing to recover fine structural details in extreme low-light conditions. This creates a practical gap in the literature: the lack of a model that provides generative-level texture recovery at edge-deployable speeds. In this paper, we address this trade-off by proposing a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN. We demonstrate that the heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. Instead, by integrating Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone and training within a conditional adversarial framework, we can approximate the high-frequency fidelity of generative models in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on the SID dataset show that our method achieves a best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN) while maintaining an inference latency of 0.06s. This represents a 40x speedup over latent diffusion models, making our approach suitable for near real-time applications."

To address these issues, we propose SecureDyn-FL, a comprehensive and robust privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework tailored for intrusion detection in IoT networks. SecureDyn-FL is designed to simultaneously address multiple security dimensions in FL-based IDS: (1) poisoning detection through dynamic temporal gradient auditing, (2) privacy protection against inference and eavesdropping attacks through secure aggregation, and (3) adaptation to heterogeneous non-IID data via personalized learning. The framework introduces three core contributions: (i) a dynamic temporal gradient auditing mechanism that leverages Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) to detect stealthy and adaptive poisoning attacks, (ii) an optimized privacy-preserving aggregation scheme based on transformed additive ElGamal encryption with adaptive pruning and quantization for secure and efficient communication, and (iii) a dual-objective personalized learning strategy that improves model adaptation under non-IID data using logit-adjusted loss. Extensive experiments on the N-BaIoT dataset under both IID and non-IID settings, including scenarios with up to 50% adversarial clients, demonstrate that SecureDyn-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL-based IDS defenses."

However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. Prior work in 2D VLMs has shown that the integration of visual inputs significantly increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks, making these models easier to manipulate into generating toxic or misleading outputs. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating 3D vision similarly compromises the robustness of 3D VLMs. To this end, we present the first systematic study of adversarial robustness in point-based 3D VLMs. We propose two complementary attack strategies: \\textit{Vision Attack}, which perturbs the visual token features produced by the 3D encoder and projector to assess the robustness of vision-language alignment; and \\textit{Caption Attack}, which directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end system robustness. Each attack includes both untargeted and targeted variants to measure general vulnerability and susceptibility to controlled manipulation. Our experiments reveal that 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, while demonstrating greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs, compared to their 2D counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of improving the adversarial robustness of 3D VLMs, especially as they are deployed in safety-critical applications."

In applied fields such as social health research, several critical questions arise: which models are most appropriate, whether to adopt unsupervised training strategies, what training scale is feasible under computational constraints, and how much such strategies benefit downstream performance. These decisions are often costly and require specialized expertise.\n  In this paper, we answer these questions through empirical analysis and provide practical insights into how to select and adapt foundation models for datasets with limited size and labels, while leveraging larger, unlabeled datasets through unsupervised training.

Today, securing these languages still demands substantial human effort to craft and enforce rules, imposing heavy burdens on typical administrators and creating critical production risks (e.g., misoperations that shut down servers).Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, vulnerability detection, and automated repair for languages like Python and JavaScript. However, their ability to assist with generating secure scripting-language code remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we present SecGenEval-PS, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on secure scripting generation, security analysis, and automated repair. Our results show that both proprietary and open-source models fall short in these areas. For instance, over 60% of PowerShell scripts produced by GPT-4o and o3-mini are insecure without structured guidance.To bridge this gap, we propose PSSec, a framework that combines data synthesis with fine-tuning to enhance model security capabilities. We develop a self-debugging agent that integrates static analyzers with the reasoning abilities of advanced LLMs to synthesize large-scale structured triplets of insecure scripts, violation analyses, and corresponding repairs. We then fine-tune lightweight LLMs (as small as 1.7B parameters) using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), enabling security-aware reasoning and the generation of secure PowerShell code.Across multiple LLM families, including GPT and Qwen, \\textit{PSSec}-trained models match or surpass general-purpose large models on PowerShell security tasks while reducing inference cost by more than an order of magnitude."

To address this, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates robustness across multiple perturbation types, including general text edits (e.g., punctuation, whitespace), formatting changes (e.g., JSON, YAML), multilingual and cross-lingual inputs, and positional variations in instructions. Evaluating 11 models ranging from 4B to 120B+ parameters, we find that minor perturbations reduce performance by up to 40 percentage points on key enterprise metrics. Critically, we demonstrate that the relationship between model size and robustness is more nuanced than conventional assumptions suggest: an 8B parameter model (Ministral 3 8B) outperforms most larger models, while another 8B model (Llama 3.1 8B) performs worst overall."

In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s \"CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Winter\" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment.

Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility."

        "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely adopted due to their efficiency and portability; however, their decoding algorithms still face multiple challenges, including inadequate generalization, adversarial vulnerability, and privacy leakage. This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs."

        "abstract": "Vulnerabilities severely threaten software systems, making the timely application of security patches crucial for mitigating attacks. However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \\underline{Str}ucture-gu\\underline{ide}d joint \\underline{r}epresentation \\underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark."

Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint.

We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments.

Our proof-of-concept platform, AIBoMGen, automates the generation of signed AIBOMs by capturing datasets, model metadata, and environment details during training. The training platform acts as a neutral, third-party observer and root of trust. It enforces verifiable AIBOM creation for every job. The system uses cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and in-toto attestations to ensure integrity and protect against threats such as artifact tampering by dishonest model creators. Our evaluation demonstrates that AIBoMGen reliably detects unauthorized modifications to all artifacts and can generate AIBOMs with negligible performance overhead.

While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval."

Existing black-box attacks on LM-based vulnerability detectors primarily rely on isolated perturbation strategies, limiting their ability to efficiently explore the adversarial code space for optimal perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HogVul achieves an average attack success rate improvement of 26.05\\% over state-of-the-art baseline methods. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid optimization strategies in exposing model vulnerabilities."

However, advancements in quantum computing threaten the security of classical cryptographic schemes, jeopardizing blockchain integrity once cryptographic quantum supremacy is achieved. This milestone, defined here as the realization of quantum computers to solve practical cryptographic problems, would render existing security standards vulnerable, exposing blockchain assets (currency, data, etc.) to fraud and theft. To address this risk, we propose and implement a smart contract deployable on the Ethereum blockchain, having the ability to run applications on its blockchain, that generates classically intractable puzzles by probabilistically generating large, hard-to-factor numbers without requiring secret information. This contract then serves two purposes: to establish a mechanism (1) for a trustless, unbiased proof of cryptographic quantum supremacy by verifying solutions to these puzzles, and (2) to protect user funds on Ethereum by triggering quantum-secure fallback protocols upon detecting cryptographic quantum supremacy, since it is desirable to wait as long as possible to fall back to a quantum-secure scheme because of its inherent additional cost and complexity. These mechanisms demonstrate the ability to identify cryptographic vulnerabilities and ensure a smooth transition to quantum-secure standards, safeguarding blockchain assets in a post-quantum era."

Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid \"ground truth\" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery."

        "abstract": "Large language model agents equipped with persistent memory are vulnerable to memory poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious instructions through query only interactions that corrupt the agents long term memory and influence future responses. Recent work demonstrated that the MINJA (Memory Injection Attack) achieves over 95 % injection success rate and 70 % attack success rate under idealized conditions. However, the robustness of these attacks in realistic deployments and effective defensive mechanisms remain understudied. This work addresses these gaps through systematic empirical evaluation of memory poisoning attacks and defenses in Electronic Health Record (EHR) agents. We investigate attack robustness by varying three critical dimensions: initial memory state, number of indication prompts, and retrieval parameters. Our experiments on GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models using MIMIC-III clinical data reveal that realistic conditions with pre-existing legitimate memories dramatically reduce attack effectiveness. We then propose and evaluate two novel defense mechanisms: (1) Input/Output Moderation using composite trust scoring across multiple orthogonal signals, and (2) Memory Sanitization with trust-aware retrieval employing temporal decay and pattern-based filtering. Our defense evaluation reveals that effective memory sanitization requires careful trust threshold calibration to prevent both overly conservative rejection (blocking all entries) and insufficient filtering (missing subtle attacks), establishing important baselines for future adaptive defense mechanisms. These findings provide crucial insights for securing memory-augmented LLM agents in production environments."

Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets.

The methodology combines dynamic asset eligibility, deterministic rebalancing, and bounded multi-factor tilts applied to an equal-weight baseline. Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility. The resulting approach is fully algorithmic, transparent, and directly implementable. It provides a robustness-oriented alternative to parametric optimization and unconstrained multi-factor models, particularly suited for long-horizon allocations where stability and operational feasibility are primary objectives."

Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic \"mass gap,\" maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \\times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \\to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold."

In response, we propose $PC^2$, the first black-box political jailbreaking framework for T2I models. It exploits a novel vulnerability where safety filters evaluate political sensitivity based on linguistic context. $PC^2$ operates through: (1) Identity-Preserving Descriptive Mapping to obfuscate sensitive keywords into neutral descriptions, and (2) Geopolitically Distal Translation to map these descriptions into fragmented, low-sensitivity languages. This strategy prevents filters from constructing toxic relationships between political entities within prompts, effectively bypassing detection. We construct a benchmark of 240 politically sensitive prompts involving 36 public figures. Evaluation on commercial T2I models, specifically GPT-series, shows that while all original prompts are blocked, $PC^2$ achieves attack success rates of up to 86%."

This occurs when one defense changes an aspect of a microarchitecture that is crucial for the security of another defense. We refer to this problem as a microarchitectural defense assumption violation} (MDAV).\n  We propose a two-step methodology to screen for potential MDAVs in the early-stage of integration. The first step is to design and integrate a composed model, guided by bounded model checking of security properties. The second step is to implement the model concretely on a simulator and to evaluate with simulated attacks. As a contribution supporting the first step, we propose an event-based modeling framework, called Maestro, for testing and evaluating microarchitectural models with integrated defenses. In our evaluation, Maestro reveals MDAVs (8), supports compact expression (~15x Alloy LoC ratio), enables semantic composability and eliminates performance degradations (>100x).\n  As a contribution supporting the second step, we use an event-based simulator (GEM5) for investigating integrated microarchitectural defenses. We show that a covert channel attack is possible on a naively integrated implementation of some state-of-the-art defenses, and a repaired implementation using our integration methodology is resilient to the attack."

To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion.

        "abstract": "A central belief in scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for instruction following (IF) tasks is that, a diverse mixture of verifiable hard and unverifiable soft constraints is essential for generalizing to unseen instructions. In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\\% in performance while achieving a 58\\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards."

        "abstract": "With the advancement of network technologies, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have emerged to deliver increasingly precise and tailored personalized learning services. Cognitive diagnosis (CD) has emerged as a core research task in ITS, aiming to infer learners' mastery of specific knowledge concepts by modeling the mapping between learning behavior data and knowledge states. However, existing research prioritizes model performance enhancement while neglecting the pervasive noise contamination in observed response data, significantly hindering practical deployment. Furthermore, current cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) rely heavily on researchers' domain expertise for structural design, which fails to exhaustively explore architectural possibilities, thus leaving model architectures' full potential untapped. To address this issue, we propose OSCD, an evolutionary multi-objective One-Shot neural architecture search method for Cognitive Diagnosis, designed to efficiently and robustly improve the model's capability in assessing learner proficiency. Specifically, OSCD operates through two distinct stages: training and searching. During the training stage, we construct a search space encompassing diverse architectural combinations and train a weight-sharing supernet represented via the complete binary tree topology, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential architectures beyond manual design priors. In the searching stage, we formulate the optimal architecture search under heterogeneous noise scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and develop an optimization framework integrating a Pareto-optimal solution search strategy with cross-scenario performance evaluation for resolution. Extensive experiments on real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the optimal architectures discovered by our OSCD model for CD tasks."

We further evaluate a deployment-time orientation search that selects a discrete rotation maximizing a forest-level confidence proxy without updating model parameters. Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can be harmful near the canonical orientation when confidence is misaligned with correctness. Finally, we observe consistent trends on MNIST digit recognition implemented as one-vs-rest regression, highlighting both the promise and limitations of confidence-based orientation selection for model-tree ensembles."

        "abstract": "Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is increasingly confounded by \\emph{variant contamination}: the training corpus contains semantically equivalent yet lexically or syntactically altered versions of test items. Unlike verbatim leakage, these paraphrased or structurally transformed variants evade existing detectors based on sampling consistency or perplexity, thereby inflating benchmark scores via memorization rather than genuine reasoning. We formalize this problem and introduce \\textbf{DVD} (\\textbf{D}etection via \\textbf{V}ariance of generation \\textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \\emph{memory-adherence} state and a \\emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \\textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters. Our results establish variance of the generation distribution as a principled and practical fingerprint for detecting variant contamination in LLM evaluation."

Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective baseline for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim is competitive with respect to specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes."

Centralised archi-tectures, though widely used, pose privacy and scalabil-ity challenges due to the aggregation of sensitive biomet-ric data. Decentralised identity frameworks offer better data sovereignty and eliminate single points of failure but introduce new security concerns, particularly around mu-tual trust among distributed devices. In such environments, biometric sensors and verification agents must authenticate one another before sharing sensitive biometric data. Ex-isting authentication schemes rely on classical public key infrastructure, which is increasingly susceptible to quan-tum attacks. This work addresses this gap by propos-ing a quantum-secure communication protocol for decen-tralised biometric systems, built upon an enhanced Quan-tum Key Distribution (QKD) system. The protocol incorpo-rates quantum-resilient authentication at both the classical and quantum layers of QKD: post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is used to secure the classical channel, while authen-tication qubits verify the integrity of the quantum channel. Once trust is established, QKD generates symmetric keys for encrypting biometric data in transit. Qiskit-based sim-ulations show a key generation rate of 15 bits/sec and 89% efficiency. This layered, quantum-resilient approach offers scalable, robust authentication for next-generation smart city infrastructures."

By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub."

In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance. These findings confirm MIA as a practical metric and highlight the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications."

However, delay-based PUFs are vulnerable to Machine Learning Attacks (MLAs), undermining their assumed unclonability. There are no valid metrics for evaluating PUF MLA resistance, but empirical modelling experiments, which lack theoretical guarantees and are highly sensitive to advances in machine learning techniques. To address the fundamental gap between PUF designs and security qualifications, this work proposes a novel, formal, and unified framework for evaluating PUF security against modelling attacks by providing security lower bounds, independent of specific attack models or learning algorithms. We mathematically characterise the adversary's advantage in predicting responses to unseen challenges based solely on observed challenge-response pairs (CRPs), formulating the problem as a conditional probability estimation over the space of candidate PUFs. We present our analysis on previous \"broken\" PUFs, e.g., Arbiter PUFs, XOR PUFs, Feed-Forward PUFs, and for the first time compare their MLA resistance in a formal way. In addition, we evaluate the currently \"secure\" CT PUF, and show its security boundary. We demonstrate that the proposed approach systematically quantifies PUF resilience, captures subtle security differences, and provides actionable, theoretically grounded security guarantees for the practical deployment of PUFs."

To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor.

Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages.

This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\\times$ to 4$\\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation.

Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats. MB-Defense comprises two stages: (i) defensive poisoning, which merges attacker and defensive triggers into a unified backdoor representation, and (ii) weight recovery, which breaks this representation through additional training to restore clean behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs show that MB-Defense substantially lowers attack success rates while preserving instruction-following ability.

We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption.

Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability."

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes."

        "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks pose significant threats to large language models (LLMs), enabling attackers to bypass safeguards. However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04010v1",
        "abstract": "In operational technology (OT) contexts, containerised applications often require elevated privileges to access low-level network interfaces or perform administrative tasks such as application monitoring. These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors."

        "abstract": "Objective: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disabilities. One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives."

        "abstract": "In Bayesian single-item auctions, a monotone bidding strategy--one that prescribes a higher bid for a higher value type--can be equivalently represented as a partition of the quantile space into consecutive intervals corresponding to increasing bids. Kumar et al. (2024) prove that agile online gradient descent (OGD), when used to update a monotone bidding strategy through its quantile representation, is strategically robust in repeated first-price auctions: when all bidders employ agile OGD in this way, the auctioneer's average revenue per round is at most the revenue of Myerson's optimal auction, regardless of how she adjusts the reserve price over time.\n  In this work, we show that this strategic robustness guarantee is not unique to agile OGD or to the first-price auction: any no-regret learning algorithm, when fed gradient feedback with respect to the quantile representation, is strategically robust, even if the auction format changes every round, provided the format satisfies allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation. In particular, the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal regret guarantee and the best-known strategic robustness guarantee. At a technical level, our results are established via a simple relation that bridges Myerson's auction theory and standard no-regret learning theory. This showcases the potential of translating standard regret guarantees into strategic robustness guarantees for specific games, without explicitly minimizing any form of swap regret."

Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains."

It then employs class-wise adversarial learning to suppress gesture semantic and leverages unsupervised clustering to automatically uncover latent domain factors responsible for distributional shifts. These latent domains are then aligned through adversarial learning to support robust cross-domain generalization. Finally, the system is applied to the target environment for robust gesture inference. We deployed GesFi under both single-pair and multi-pair settings using commodity WiFi transceivers, and evaluated it across multiple public datasets and real-world environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, GesFi achieves up to 78% and 50% performance improvements over existing adversarial methods, and consistently outperforms prior generalization approaches across most cross-domain tasks."

However, their complex multimodal interactions also expose new security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we investigate a backdoor threat in VLA models, where malicious inputs cause targeted misbehavior while preserving performance on clean data. Existing backdoor methods predominantly rely on inserting visible triggers into visual modality, which suffer from poor robustness and low insusceptibility in real-world settings due to environmental variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the State Backdoor, a novel and practical backdoor attack that leverages the robot arm's initial state as the trigger. To optimize trigger for insusceptibility and effectiveness, we design a Preference-guided Genetic Algorithm (PGA) that efficiently searches the state space for minimal yet potent triggers. Extensive experiments on five representative VLA models and five real-world tasks show that our method achieves over 90% attack success rate without affecting benign task performance, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in embodied AI systems."

However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

In IEC61850 based smart substations, the Manufacturing Message Specification protocol operates over TCP to facilitate communication between SCADA systems and field devices such as Intelligent Electronic Devices and Programmable Logic Controllers. Although MMS enables efficient monitoring and control, it can be exploited by adversaries to generate legitimate looking packets for reconnaissance, unauthorized state reading, and malicious command injection, thereby disrupting grid operations. In this work, we propose a fully automated attack detection and prevention framework for IEC61850 compliant smart substations to counter remote cyberattacks that manipulate process states through compromised PLCs and IEDs. A detailed analysis of the MMS protocol is presented, and critical MMS field value pairs are extracted during both normal SCADA operation and active attack conditions. The proposed framework is validated using seven datasets comprising benign operational scenarios and multiple attack instances, including IEC61850Bean based attacks and script driven attacks leveraging the libiec61850 library. Our approach accurately identifies attack signature carrying MMS packets that attempt to disrupt circuit breaker status, specifically targeting the smart home zone IED and PLC of the EPIC testbed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in precisely detecting malicious MMS traffic and enhancing the cyber resilience of IEC61850 based smart grid environments."

        "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) in commercial and research settings has intensified the need for robust intellectual property protection. Backdoor-based LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a promising solution for this challenge. In practical application, the low-cost multi-model collaborative technique, LLM ensemble, combines diverse LLMs to leverage their complementary strengths, garnering significant attention and practical adoption. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of existing LLM fingerprinting for the ensemble scenario is unexplored. In order to comprehensively assess the robustness of LLM fingerprinting, in this paper, we propose two novel fingerprinting attack methods: token filter attack (TFA) and sentence verification attack (SVA). The TFA gets the next token from a unified set of tokens created by the token filter mechanism at each decoding step. The SVA filters out fingerprint responses through a sentence verification mechanism based on perplexity and voting. Experimentally, the proposed methods effectively inhibit the fingerprint response while maintaining ensemble performance. Compared with state-of-the-art attack methods, the proposed method can achieve better performance. The findings necessitate enhanced robustness in LLM fingerprinting."

        "abstract": "Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Our analysis reveals a dualistic nature of the parameter l. According to the previous analysis, it does not affect resistance to guessing attacks. A deeper examination of the verification mechanism demonstrates that l establishes a kind of verification barrier of l times m bits.

However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini."

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance."

The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K) = (\\mathbf{1}(1 \\in \\mathcal{I}),\\ldots,\\mathbf{1}(K\\in \\mathcal{I}))$, where $\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \\textit{rank-increment condition}: $\\mathrm{rank}\\left(\\bigl[\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}};\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr]\\right) =\\mathrm{rank}\\bigl(\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr)+N$.

Using an observational design, 100 correction replies across five high-conflict misinformation topics were analyzed, with corrections balanced between Grok-mediated and direct human-issued responses. The primary outcome was whether a correction received at least one ad hominem attack within a 24-hour window. Ad hominem attacks occurred in 72 percent of human-issued corrections and in none of the Grok-mediated corrections. A chi-square test confirmed a statistically significant association with a large effect size. These findings suggest that AI-mediated correction may alter the social dynamics of public disagreement by reducing interpersonal hostility during misinformation responses."

To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness."

        "abstract": "Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection."

We postulate that a better understanding of how veteran analysts evaluate reports, including their feedback, can help produce analysis reports in SOCs. In this paper, we aim to leverage LLMs for analysis reports. To this end, we first construct a Analyst-wise checklist to reflect SOC practitioners' opinions for analysis report evaluation through literature review and user study with SOC practitioners. Next, we design a novel LLM-based conceptual framework, named MESSALA, by further introducing two new techniques, granularization guideline and multi-perspective evaluation. MESSALA can maximize report evaluation and provide feedback on veteran SOC practitioners' perceptions. When we conduct extensive experiments with MESSALA, the evaluation results by MESSALA are the closest to those of veteran SOC practitioners compared with the existing LLM-based methods. We then show two key insights. We also conduct qualitative analysis with MESSALA, and then identify that MESSALA can provide actionable items that are necessary for improving analysis reports."

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released."

We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores."

To address this gap, we proposed a stochastic simulation framework that enables analysis of selfish mining with multiple attackers across various consensus protocols. We created the model of Proof-of-Work (PoW) Nakamoto consensus (serving as the baseline) as well as models of two additional consensus protocols designed to mitigate selfish mining: Fruitchain and Strongchain. Using our framework, thresholds reported in the literature were verified, and several novel thresholds were discovered for 2 and more attackers.

This paper examines the design, implementation, and testing of lightweight cryptographic algorithms that have been specifically designed to be used in secure embedded systems. A comparison of some of the state-of-the-art lightweight encryption algorithms, that is PRESENT, SPECK, and SIMON, focuses on the main performance indicators, i.e., throughput, use of memory, and energy utilization. The study presents novel lightweight algorithms that are founded upon the Feistel-network architecture and their safety under cryptanalytic attacks, e.g., differential and linear cryptanalysis. The proposed solutions are proven through hardware implementation on the FPGA platform. The results have shown that lightweight cryptography is an effective strategy that could be used to establish security and maintain performance in the IoT and other resource-limited settings."

We formalize a corresponding threat model and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of targeted manipulations of real data (e.g., label flipping and feature-importance-based interventions) on the quality of generated synthetic data. The results show that even small perturbations can substantially reduce downstream predictive performance and increase statistical divergence, exposing vulnerabilities within SDG pipelines.

By combining shifted window self-attention with U-Net style skip connections, the model captures both global context and fine anatomical detail. We evaluate SwinUNet3D on the AutoPET III FDG dataset and compare it against a baseline 3D U-Net. Results show that SwinUNet3D achieves a Dice score of 0.88 and IoU of 0.78, surpassing 3D U-Net (Dice 0.48, IoU 0.32) while also delivering faster inference times. Qualitative analysis demonstrates improved detection of small and irregular lesions, reduced false positives, and more accurate PET/CT fusion. While the framework is currently limited to FDG scans and trained under modest GPU resources, it establishes a strong foundation for future multi-tracer, multi-center evaluations and benchmarking against other transformer-based architectures. Overall, SwinUNet3D represents an efficient and robust approach to PET/CT lesion segmentation, advancing the integration of transformer-based models into oncology imaging workflows."

However, realistic scenarios often demand delayed and variable-specific activation. We identify this critical unmet need and propose TDBA, a temporally decoupled backdoor attack framework for MTS forecasting. By injecting triggers that encode the expected location of the target pattern, TDBA enables the activation of the target pattern at any positions within the forecasted data, with the activation position flexibly varying across different variable dimensions. TDBA introduces two core modules: (1) a position-guided trigger generation mechanism that leverages smoothed Gaussian priors to generate triggers that are position-related to the predefined target pattern; and (2) a position-aware optimization module that assigns soft weights based on trigger completeness, pattern coverage, and temporal offset, facilitating targeted and stealthy attack optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that TDBA consistently outperforms existing baselines in effectiveness while maintaining good stealthiness. Ablation studies confirm the controllability and robustness of its design."

This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds. Our findings reveal that aggregating localized evidence is fundamentally more effective than global averaging, exposing critical privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs."

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating \"topological short-circuits\" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research."

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI."

The old methods of detecting and reacting to threats which are mostly reliant on fixed signatures, predefined rules and human operators are becoming less and less effective even in the advanced stages of cyberattacks of cloud infrastructures. The recent trend in the field of addressing these limitations is the creation of technologies of artificial intelligence (AI). The strategies allow independent protection, anomaly detection, and real-time analysis with references to using deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. Through imbuing AI with a constantly-learning feature, it enables the intrusion detection system to be more accurate and generate a lesser number of false positives and it also enables the possibility of adaptive and predictive security. The fusion of large-scale language models with efficient orchestration platforms contributes to reacting to the arising threats with a quicker and more precise response. This allows automatic control over incidences, self-healing network, and defense mechanisms on a policy basis. Considering the current detection and response methods, this discussion assesses their strengths and weaknesses and outlines key issues such as data privacy, adversarial machine learning and integration complexity in the context of AI-based cloud security.

        "abstract": "Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks."

On Mistral-7B-Instruct evaluated against a 249-prompt attack set spanning five attack families, TRYLOCK achieves 88.0% relative ASR reduction (46.5% to 5.6%), with each layer contributing unique coverage: RepE blocks 36% of attacks that bypass DPO alone, while canonicalization catches 14% of encoding attacks that evade both. We discover a non-monotonic steering phenomenon -- intermediate strength (alpha=1.0) degrades safety below baseline -- and provide mechanistic hypotheses explaining RepE-DPO interference. The adaptive sidecar reduces over-refusal from 60% to 48% while maintaining identical attack defense, demonstrating that security and usability need not be mutually exclusive. We release all components -- trained adapters, steering vectors, sidecar classifier, preference pairs, and complete evaluation methodology -- enabling full reproducibility."

Traditionally, assets are determined manually by security experts, requiring significant time and expertise. To address this challenge, we present LAsset, a novel automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify security assets from both hardware design specifications and register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions. The framework performs structural and semantic analysis to identify intra-module primary and secondary assets and derives inter-module relationships to systematically characterize security dependencies at the design level. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high classification accuracy, reaching up to 90% recall rate in SoC design, and 93% recall rate in IP designs. This automation in asset identification significantly reduces manual overhead and supports a scalable path forward for secure hardware development."

As a consequence, the construction supports the design of decentralized mining pools in which work attribution is verifiable and withholding incentives are substantially reduced. The scheme preserves the fundamental properties of conventional PoW, including public verifiability and difficulty adjustment, while adding an orthogonal auditability layer tailored to pool-based mining. Finally, while a full deployment of APoW in Bitcoin would require a consensus rule change and minor modifications to mining ASICs, the construction remains practically useful even without consensus changes, for instance, as a pool-level auditing mechanism that enables verifiable pay-for-auditing using existing pool reserves."

        "abstract": "Detecting unknown deepfake manipulations remains one of the most challenging problems in face forgery detection. Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection."

        "abstract": "Software testing has progressed toward intelligent automation, yet current AI-based test generators still suffer from static, single-shot outputs that frequently produce invalid, redundant, or non-executable tests due to the lack of execution aware feedback. This paper introduces an agentic multi-model testing framework a closed-loop, self-correcting system in which a Test Generation Agent, an Execution and Analysis Agent, and a Review and Optimization Agent collaboratively generate, execute, analyze, and refine tests until convergence. By using sandboxed execution, detailed failure reporting, and iterative regeneration or patching of failing tests, the framework autonomously improves test quality and expands coverage. Integrated into a CI/CD-compatible pipeline, it leverages reinforcement signals from coverage metrics and execution outcomes to guide refinement. Empirical evaluations on microservice based applications show up to a 60% reduction in invalid tests, 30% coverage improvement, and significantly reduced human effort compared to single-model baselines demonstrating that multi-agent, feedback-driven loops can evolve software testing into an autonomous, continuously learning quality assurance ecosystem for self-healing, high-reliability codebases."

        "abstract": "Coding theory plays a crucial role in enabling reliable communication, storage, and computation. Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.\n  In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research."

In this study we investigates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical learning to enhance feature representations for intrusion detection and explore possible quantum advantages in cybersecurity analytics. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, network traffic is transformed into structured feature vectors through classical preprocessing and normalization. Classical models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines with linear and RBF kernels, are evaluated on the full dataset to establish baseline performance under large-sample conditions. Simultaneously, a quantum-enhanced pipeline maps classical features into variational quantum circuits via angle encoding and entangling layers, executed on a CPU-based quantum simulator, with resulting quantum embeddings classified using a classical SVM. Experiments show that while classical models achieve higher overall accuracy with large datasets, quantum-enhanced representations demonstrate superior attack recall and improved class separability when data is scarce, suggesting that quantum feature spaces capture complex correlations inaccessible to shallow classical models. These results highlight the potential of quantum embeddings to improve generalization and representation quality in cybersecurity tasks and provide a reproducible framework for evaluating quantum advantages as quantum hardware and simulators continue to advance."

        "abstract": "Video recognition models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while existing diffusion-based purification methods suffer from inefficient sampling and curved trajectories. Directly regressing clean videos from adversarial inputs often fails to recover faithful content due to the subtle nature of perturbations; this necessitates physically shattering the adversarial structure. Therefore, we propose Flow Matching for Adversarial Video Purification FMVP. FMVP physically shatters global adversarial structures via a masking strategy and reconstructs clean video dynamics using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with an inpainting objective. To further decouple semantic content from adversarial noise, we design a Frequency-Gated Loss (FGL) that explicitly suppresses high-frequency adversarial residuals while preserving low-frequency fidelity. We design Attack-Aware and Generalist training paradigms to handle known and unknown threats, respectively. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 demonstrate that FMVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods (DiffPure, Defense Patterns (DP), Temporal Shuffling (TS) and FlowPure), achieving robust accuracy exceeding 87% against PGD and 89% against CW attacks. Furthermore, FMVP demonstrates superior robustness against adaptive attacks (DiffHammer) and functions as a zero-shot adversarial detector, attaining AUC-ROC scores of 0.98 for PGD and 0.79 for highly imperceptible CW attacks."

        "abstract": "Automated cyber defense (ACD) seeks to protect computer networks with minimal or no human intervention, reacting to intrusions by taking corrective actions such as isolating hosts, resetting services, deploying decoys, or updating access controls. However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines."

In this model, an adversary, upon looking at a \"clean\" i.i.d. dataset, inserts additional \"corrupted\" points of their choice into the dataset. These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees. Our results showcase how optimal learning algorithms break down in the face of seemingly helpful monotone corruptions, exposing their overreliance on exchangeability."

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of speech synthesis technologies, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), has intensified security and privacy concerns related to voice cloning. Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.\n  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats."

The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduce the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising. This work establishes task aware data subsampling as a learnable component, providing a principled solution for effective large-scale data learning."

Ensuring robustness against even minor input perturbations is therefore critical for maintaining reliable performance in real-time environments. While prior work has mainly examined accuracy degradation under adversarial attacks, robustness with respect to efficiency remains largely unexplored. This narrow focus provides only a partial understanding of ASR model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of ASR robustness under multiple attack scenarios. We introduce MORE, a multi-objective repetitive doubling encouragement attack, which jointly degrades recognition accuracy and inference efficiency through a hierarchical staged repulsion-anchoring mechanism. Specifically, we reformulate multi-objective adversarial optimization into a hierarchical framework that sequentially achieves the dual objectives. To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack."

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing local data. However, backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to FL. These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy."

We evaluate the robustness of a hybrid quantum machine learning model, quanvolutional neural networks (QNNs) against classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under four acoustic corruptions (Gaussian noise, pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation) in a clean-train/corrupted-test regime. Using AVFAD (voice pathology) and TESS (speech emotion), we compare three QNN models (Random, Basic, Strongly) to a simple CNN baseline (CNN-Base), ResNet-18 and VGG-16 using accuracy and corruption metrics (CE, mCE, RCE, RmCE), and analyze architectural factors (circuit complexity or depth, convergence) alongside per-emotion robustness. QNNs generally outperform the CNN-Base under pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation (up to 22% lower CE/RCE at severe temporal shift), while the CNN-Base remains more resilient to Gaussian noise. Among quantum circuits, QNN-Basic achieves the best overall robustness on AVFAD, and QNN-Random performs strongest on TESS. Emotion-wise, fear is most robust (80-90% accuracy under severe corruptions), neutral can collapse under strong Gaussian noise (5.5% accuracy), and happy is most vulnerable to pitch, temporal, and speed distortions. QNNs also converge up to six times faster than the CNN-Base. To our knowledge, this is a systematic study of QNN robustness for speech under common non-adversarial acoustic corruptions, indicating that shallow entangling quantum front-ends can improve noise resilience while sensitivity to additive noise remains a challenge."

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown considerable potential in autonomous driving (AD), yet its vulnerability to perturbations remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods."

To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs"

A critical challenge is cross-attack generalization: can detectors trained on known attack families recognize novel, unseen attack types? We discover that standard conversational tokenization -- capturing linguistic patterns from agent interactions -- fails catastrophically on structural attacks like tool hijacking (AUC 0.39) and data exfiltration (AUC 0.46), while succeeding on linguistic attacks like social engineering (AUC 0.78). We introduce structural tokenization, encoding execution-flow patterns (tool calls, arguments, observations) rather than conversational content. This simple representational change dramatically improves cross-attack generalization: +46 AUC points on tool hijacking, +39 points on data exfiltration, and +71 points on unknown attacks, while simultaneously improving in-distribution performance (+6 points). For attacks requiring linguistic features, we propose gated multi-view fusion that adaptively combines both representations, achieving AUC 0.89 on social engineering without sacrificing structural attack detection. Our findings reveal that AI agent security is fundamentally a structural problem: attack semantics reside in execution patterns, not surface language. While our rule-based tokenizer serves as a baseline, the structural abstraction principle generalizes even with simple implementation."

The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, these results are achieved with significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and substantially lower computational overhead."

We propose \\textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics."

        "abstract": "In the face of adverse motives, it is indispensable to achieve a consensus. Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections."

Since coastal scenarios are unpredictable and scenes have dynamic properties it is essential to apply detection methods that are robust to these conditions. This paper presents modified ViBe for moving object detection which detects ships and backwash. In the modified ViBe the probability of losing ships is decreased in comparison with the original ViBe. It is robust to natural sea waves and variation of lights and is capable of quickly updating the background. Based on geometrical properties of ship and some concepts such as brightness distortion, a new method for backwash cancellation is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy and methods have outstanding performance in ship detection and tracking. These results also illustrate real time and precise performance of the proposed strategy."

        "abstract": "Deep learning has been extensively used in medical imaging applications, assuming that the test and training datasets belong to the same probability distribution. However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets."

In this paper, we present SmoothSync, a novel framework that leverages quantized audio tokens in a novel dual-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesis holistic gestures and enhance sampling variation. Specifically, we (1) fuse audio-motion features via complementary transformer streams to achieve superior synchronization, (2) introduce a jitter-suppression loss to improve temporal smoothness, (3) implement probabilistic audio quantization to generate distinct gesture sequences from identical inputs. To reliably evaluate beat synchronization under jitter, we introduce Smooth-BC, a robust variant of the beat consistency metric less sensitive to motion noise. Comprehensive experiments on the BEAT2 and SHOW datasets demonstrate SmoothSync's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by -30.6% FGD, 10.3% Smooth-BC, and 8.4% Diversity on BEAT2, while reducing jitter and foot sliding by -62.9% and -17.1% respectively.

Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/\u03b3$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms the baselines across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while remaining robust under fp16/bf16 precision and keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\\times$--1.08$\\times$ of MeZO)."

To enable hardware aware spintronic implementation, the generator's deconvolution layers are restructured as zero padded convolution, allowing seamless integration with a 6-bit skyrmion based synapse in a crossbar, without compromising training performance. Nonlinear activation functions are implemented using a hybrid CMOS domain wall based Rectified linear unit (ReLU) and Leaky ReLU units.

Existing methods attempt to address both tasks within a single unified stage. We question this design, as the annotation imbalance between known and unknown classes often leads to negative transfer of known classes and underfitting for unknowns. To overcome these issues, we propose SATS, a Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy, which addresses OSDA-SS through two sequential steps: known/unknown separation and unknown-aware domain adaptation. By providing the model with more accurate and well-aligned unknown classes, our method ensures a balanced learning of discriminative features for both known and unknown classes, steering the model toward discovering truly unknown objects. Additionally, we present hard unknown exploration, an innovative data augmentation method that exposes the model to more challenging unknowns, strengthening its ability to capture more comprehensive understanding of target unknowns. We evaluate our method on public OSDA-SS benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial advancement, with a +3.85% H-Score improvement for GTA5-to-Cityscapes and +18.64% for SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods."

This paper introduces a novel geometric framework based on the least concave majorants of the growth rate function. Our proposed concave certificate establishes a tight bound of DR risk that remains applicable to non-Lipschitz and non-differentiable losses. We extend this framework to complexity analysis, introducing a deterministic bound that complements standard statistical generalization bound. Furthermore, we utilize this certificate to bound the gap between adversarial and empirical Rademacher complexity, demonstrating that dependencies on input diameter, network width, and depth can be eliminated. For practical application in deep learning, we introduce the adversarial score as a tractable relaxation of the concave certificate that enables efficient and layer-wise analysis of neural networks.

We present MCP-SandboxScan, a lightweight framework motivated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that safely executes untrusted tools inside a WebAssembly/WASI sandbox and produces auditable reports of external-to-sink exposures. Our prototype (i) extracts LLM-relevant sinks from runtime outputs (prompt/messages and structured tool-return fields), (ii) instantiates external-input candidates from environment values, mounted file contents, and output-surfaced HTTP fetch intents, and (iii) links sources to sinks via snippet-based substring matching. Case studies on three representative tools show that MCP-SandboxScan can surface provenance evidence when external inputs appear in prompt/messages or tool-return payloads, and can expose filesystem capability violations as runtime evidence.

        "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things devices in critical infrastructure has created unprecedented cybersecurity challenges, necessitating collaborative threat detection mechanisms that preserve data privacy while maintaining robustness against sophisticated attacks. Traditional federated learning approaches for IoT security suffer from two critical vulnerabilities: susceptibility to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants poison model updates, and inadequacy against future quantum computing threats that can compromise cryptographic aggregation protocols. This paper presents a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework integrated with post-quantum secure aggregation specifically designed for real-time threat intelligence sharing across critical IoT infrastructure. The proposed framework combines a adaptive weighted aggregation mechanism with lattice-based cryptographic protocols to simultaneously defend against model poisoning attacks and quantum adversaries. We introduce a reputation-based client selection algorithm that dynamically identifies and excludes Byzantine participants while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. The secure aggregation protocol employs CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and homomorphic encryption to ensure confidentiality during parameter updates. Experimental evaluation on industrial IoT intrusion detection datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves 96.8% threat detection accuracy while successfully mitigating up to 40% Byzantine attackers, with only 18% computational overhead compared to non-secure federated approaches. The framework maintains sub-second aggregation latency suitable for real-time applications and provides 256-bit post-quantum security level."

        "abstract": "Diffusion policies have emerged as powerful generative models for offline policy learning, whose sampling process can be rigorously characterized by a score function guiding a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). However, the same score-based SDE modeling that grants diffusion policies the flexibility to learn diverse behavior also incurs solver and score-matching errors, large data requirements, and inconsistencies in action generation. While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance. We develop an in-depth theoretical analysis along with a practical implementation recipe to incorporate CDPs into existing diffusion policy architectures with minimal modification and computational cost. We evaluate CDPs for offline learning by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings. Across benchmarks, CDPs often outperform baseline policies, with pronounced benefits under data scarcity."

        "abstract": "The growing reliance on deep learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare and autonomous navigation underscores the need for defenses that are both robust to adversarial perturbations and transparent in their decision-making. In this paper, we identify a connection between interpretability and robustness that can be directly leveraged during training. Specifically, we observe that spurious, unstable, or semantically irrelevant features identified through Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) contribute disproportionately to adversarial vulnerability. Building on this insight, we introduce an attribution-guided refinement framework that transforms LIME from a passive diagnostic into an active training signal. Our method systematically suppresses spurious features using feature masking, sensitivity-aware regularization, and adversarial augmentation in a closed-loop refinement pipeline. This approach does not require additional datasets or model architectures and integrates seamlessly into standard adversarial training. Theoretically, we derive an attribution-aware lower bound on adversarial distortion that formalizes the link between explanation alignment and robustness. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate substantial improvements in adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution generalization."

In addition, we introduce a network packet abstraction language that enables the creation of a pipeline similar to network packet data, and we show that network behavior provides complementary detection signals-yielding improved performance for network-focused malware at low false positive rates. Lastly, we implement these methods in an online router anomaly detection framework to validate the approach in an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment environment."

Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating \"average\" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines."

To address this, we propose Tiny Object Localization with Flows (TOLF), a noise-robust localization framework leveraging normalizing flows for flexible error modeling and uncertainty-guided optimization. Our method captures complex, non-Gaussian prediction distributions through flow-based error modeling, enabling robust learning under noisy supervision. An uncertainty-aware gradient modulation mechanism further suppresses learning from high-uncertainty, noise-prone samples, mitigating overfitting while stabilizing training. Extensive experiments across three datasets validate our approach's effectiveness. Especially, TOLF boosts the DINO baseline by 1.2% AP on the AI-TOD dataset."

Our empirical analysis reveals that even under controlled initialization and training conditions, the accuracy of the model can exhibit significant variability. To address this issue, we propose a Custom Loss Function (CLF) that reduces the sensitivity of training outcomes to stochastic factors such as weight initialization and data shuffling. By fine-tuning its parameters, CLF explicitly balances predictive accuracy with training stability, leading to more consistent and reliable model performance. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures for both image classification and time series forecasting demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training robustness without sacrificing predictive performance. These results establish CLF as an effective and efficient strategy for developing more stable, reliable and trustworthy neural networks."

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, numerous theories have been proposed to explain the widespread vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial evasion attacks. Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets."

However, when integrated with frameworks like FedIT, LoRA introduces a critical vulnerability: clients submit $A$ and $B$ matrices separately, while only their product $AB$ determines the model update, yet this composite is never directly verified. We propose Gradient Assembly Poisoning (GAP), a novel attack that exploits this blind spot by crafting individually benign $A$ and $B$ matrices whose product yields malicious updates. GAP operates without access to training data or inter-client coordination and remains undetected by standard anomaly detectors. We identify four systemic vulnerabilities in LoRA-based federated systems and validate GAP across LLaMA, ChatGLM, and GPT-2. GAP consistently induces degraded or biased outputs while preserving surface fluency, reducing BLEU by up to 14.5\\%, increasing factual and grammatical errors by over 800\\%, and maintaining 92.6\\% long-form response length.

        "abstract": "Smart home IoT platforms such as openHAB rely on Trigger Action Condition (TAC) rules to automate device behavior, but the interplay among these rules can give rise to interaction threats, unintended or unsafe behaviors emerging from implicit dependencies, conflicting triggers, or overlapping conditions. Identifying these threats requires semantic understanding and structural reasoning that traditionally depend on symbolic, constraint-driven static analysis. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a multi-category interaction threat taxonomy, assessing their performance on both the original openHAB (oHC/IoTB) dataset and a structurally challenging Mutation dataset designed to test robustness under rule transformations. We benchmark Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 70B, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 across zero-, one-, and two-shot settings, comparing their results against oHIT's manually validated ground truth. Our findings show that while LLMs exhibit promising semantic understanding, particularly on action- and condition-related threats, their accuracy degrades significantly for threats requiring cross-rule structural reasoning, especially under mutated rule forms. Model performance varies widely across threat categories and prompt settings, with no model providing consistent reliability. In contrast, the symbolic reasoning baseline maintains stable detection across both datasets, unaffected by rule rewrites or structural perturbations. These results underscore that LLMs alone are not yet dependable for safety critical interaction-threat detection in IoT environments. We discuss the implications for tool design and highlight the potential of hybrid architectures that combine symbolic analysis with LLM-based semantic interpretation to reduce false positives while maintaining structural rigor."

We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent-authored PRs using the AIDev dataset, comprising of over 33,000 curated PRs from popular GitHub repositories. Security-relevant PRs are identified using a keyword filtering strategy, followed by manual validation, resulting in 1,293 confirmed security-related agentic-PRs. We then analyze prevalence, acceptance outcomes, and review latency across autonomous agents, programming ecosystems, and types of code changes. Moreover, we apply qualitative open coding to identify recurring security-related actions and underlying intents, and examine review metadata to identify early signals associated with PR rejection. Security-related Agentic-PRs constitute a meaningful share of agent activity (approximately 4\\%). Rather than focusing solely on narrow vulnerability fixes, agents most frequently perform supportive security hardening activities, including testing, documentation, configuration, and improved error handling. Compared to non-security PRs, security-related Agentic-PRs exhibit lower merge rates and longer review latency, reflecting heightened human scrutiny, with variation across agents and programming ecosystems. PR rejection is more strongly associated with PR complexity and verbosity than with explicit security topics."

We provide a formal complexity analysis showing that M2S reduces training cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ for $n$-turn conversations. Empirically, on our training dataset (779 samples, avg. 10.6 turns), M2S requires only 169K tokens compared to 15.7M tokens for the multi-turn baseline -- a 93$\\times$ reduction. We evaluate Defensive M2S across three guardrail model families (LlamaGuard, Nemotron, Qwen3Guard) and three compression templates (hyphenize, numberize, pythonize) on SafeDialBench, a comprehensive multi-turn jailbreak benchmark. Our best configuration, Qwen3Guard with hyphenize compression, achieves 93.8% attack detection recall while reducing inference tokens by 94.6% (from 3,231 to 173 tokens per conversation). This represents a 38.9 percentage point improvement over the baseline while dramatically reducing both training and inference costs. Our findings demonstrate that M2S compression can serve as an effective efficiency technique for guardrail deployment, enabling scalable safety screening of long multi-turn conversations."

In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity.

Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset. Our method leverages a Quadruplet Loss-based learning approach for anomaly images and introduces a custom data loader that strategically selects training samples to enhance estimation accuracy. We evaluated our approach using a image datasets: captured during desktop PC assembly. The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net outperformed existing methods on the dataset. Specifically, it improved the estimation accuracy by 1.3% and reduced misclassification between adjacent tasks by 1.9% in the desktop PC dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The design supports scalar, vector, and matrix payloads with O(N*D) computation and communication complexity, optional edge-server offloading, and resistance to collusion under N-1 corruptions. Formal analysis proves correctness, Consensus-Dependent Integrity and Fairness (CDIF) with overwhelming-probability abort on deviation, and IND-CPA security assuming a pseudorandom function family. Empirical evaluations on MNIST-derived vectors demonstrate linear scalability up to N = 500 with sub-millisecond per-client computation times. The framework achieves 100% malicious deviation detection, exact data recovery, and three-to-four orders of magnitude lower FLOPs compared to MPC and HE baselines.

In this work, we investigate targeted cyberattacks on two widely used fused deposition modeling (FDM) systems, Creality's flagship model K1 Max, and Ender 3. Our threat model is a multi-layered Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) intrusion, where the adversary intercepts and manipulates G-code files during upload from the user interface to the printer firmware. The MitM intrusion chain enables several stealthy sabotage scenarios. These attacks remain undetectable by conventional slicer software or runtime interfaces, resulting in structurally defective yet externally plausible printed parts. To counter these stealthy threats, we propose an unsupervised Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that analyzes structured machine logs generated during live printing. Our defense mechanism uses a frozen Transformer-based encoder (a BERT variant) to extract semantic representations of system behavior, followed by a contrastively trained projection head that learns anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Later, a clustering-based approach and a self-attention autoencoder are used for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively distinguishes between benign and compromised executions."

Among these, patch-based adversarial attacks, where small malicious patches (e.g., stickers) are applied to objects, can deceive neural networks into making incorrect predictions with potentially severe consequences. In this paper, we present PatchBlock, a lightweight framework designed to detect and neutralize adversarial patches in images. Leveraging outlier detection and dimensionality reduction, PatchBlock identifies regions affected by adversarial noise and suppresses their impact. It operates as a pre-processing module at the sensor level, efficiently running on CPUs in parallel with GPU inference, thus preserving system throughput while avoiding additional GPU overhead. The framework follows a three-stage pipeline: splitting the input into chunks (Chunking), detecting anomalous regions via a redesigned isolation forest with targeted cuts for faster convergence (Separating), and applying dimensionality reduction on the identified outliers (Mitigating). PatchBlock is both model- and patch-agnostic, can be retrofitted to existing pipelines, and integrates seamlessly between sensor inputs and downstream models. Evaluations across multiple neural architectures, benchmark datasets, attack types, and diverse edge devices demonstrate that PatchBlock consistently improves robustness, recovering up to 77% of model accuracy under strong patch attacks such as the Google Adversarial Patch, while maintaining high portability and minimal clean accuracy loss. Additionally, PatchBlock outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses in efficiency, in terms of computation time and energy consumption per sample, making it suitable for EdgeAI applications."

This challenge has garnered significant attention within the scientific community, prompting extensive research efforts in hallucination detection and mitigation strategies. Current methodological frameworks reveal a critical limitation: traditional uncertainty quantification approaches demonstrate effectiveness primarily within conventional question-answering paradigms, yet exhibit notable deficiencies when confronted with non-canonical or adversarial questioning strategies. This performance gap raises substantial concerns regarding the dependability of LLM responses in real-world applications requiring robust critical thinking capabilities.

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is crucial for medical image analysis, enabling precise disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many advanced models employ complex architectures, limiting their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. This paper proposes MFEnNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework that incorporates MetaFormer in the encoding phase of the U-Net backbone. MetaFormer, an architectural abstraction of vision transformers, provides a versatile alternative to convolutional neural networks by transforming tokenized image patches into sequences for global context modeling. To mitigate the substantial computational cost associated with self-attention, the proposed framework replaces conventional transformer modules with pooling transformer blocks, thereby achieving effective global feature aggregation at reduced complexity. In addition, Swish activation is used to achieve smoother gradients and faster convergence, while spatial pyramid pooling is incorporated at the bottleneck to improve multi-scale feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on different medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MFEnNet approach attains competitive accuracy while significantly lowering computational cost compared to state-of-the-art models.
