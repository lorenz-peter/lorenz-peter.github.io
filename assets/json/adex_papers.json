        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding by\nintegrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models but introduces new\nattack surfaces, particularly through backdoor attacks. While prior research\nhas largely focused on disinformation threats, fairness vulnerabilities remain\nunderexplored. Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct\ntrigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction\nbetween retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships\nbetween target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert\ninfluence on content generation.\n  This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness\nvulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the\npre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group\nwith the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the\npost-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases\nto reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining\nundetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures\nprecise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and\nresilience. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BiasRAG achieves high attack\nsuccess rates while preserving contextual relevance and utility, establishing a\npersistent and evolving threat to fairness in RAG."

        "abstract": "Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging\nmodalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the\nsource domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep\nmodels. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these\nmethods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high\nvariability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\\'ezier Meets\nDiffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a\nB\\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the\ndomain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images\nenable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.\nThereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the\ntarget domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize\nhigh-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy\npseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method\nthat improves the robustness of CDM training.

To address this gap, we introduce the Textual\nDynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based\nsurrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a\nstatic single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the\nfarthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that\ndeviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing\ndisruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim\nmodels (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting\nadversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language\nmodels with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a\nmaximum attack success rate of 50.81\\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,\nreaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\\%.

We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that\ngenerates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by\nleveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks.\nCOMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by\nperturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally\nsensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal\ncoverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than\ntraditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area\nestimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures.

Obtaining such a model is not trivial, as many\nof these systems can be examined only in black box settings due to, e.g., long\nsupply chains or secrecy.

To this end, we will investigate a cyber-physical systems as a black\nbox using its external communication interface.

Our approach is realized through tripartite losses\n(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary\nsampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.\nTo enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an\ninput-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism\nthat focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight\nnormalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.\nTheoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees\nconsistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping\nPRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter\nprobability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex\ndesign in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high\nclassification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against\nvarious stochastic noises and adversarial attacks."

Prior Bit-Flip Attacks\n(BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can\nseverely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips\ncan degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs\nand reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and\nredundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs'\ncatastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically\nfocus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack\nflexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause\nperturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making\nit not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor\nvalues (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky\nBit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip\nwhile keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It\nis achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined\nparameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity\nand perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight\ndistribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to\ngreatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching\ntaking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma\nmodels, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to\nbelow random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats.\nRemarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a\nsevere security concern of SOTA LLM models."

The robust recourse literature addresses\nthis issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is\nresilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization\nproblem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),\nmost of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the\noptimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first\nprovably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized\nlinear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm.\nHowever, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high\nprice. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes\ndefined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a\nnew algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for\ngeneralized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,\nwe demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of\nrecourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also\nexhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its\nvalidity.

        "abstract": "While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on\nspecific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why\ncertain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian\nnoise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design\nrules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained\nvision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for\nimproved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input\nresolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather\nthan CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy\ngains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,\nconverting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that\nlow-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically\nwith kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy\nroughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we\ndemonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion\nto the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that\ngrows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error\nand greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the\nvulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller\nnormalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case\nsensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing\ncommon in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into\ninterpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and\nbuild practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more\nrobust against Gaussian noise."

While existing\nmethods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,\nleading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this\npaper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class\nproportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and\n(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks\ntarget. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free\nRobustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and\ndistribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a\nrobustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the\nless robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the\ndistribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness\ndistillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a\nuniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the\ndominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced\nrepresentation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target\nAdversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class\nconstraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack\ntargets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable\ncategories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD\nachieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack\n(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by\n15.1\\% and 6.4\\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior\nperformance in both robustness and fairness aspects."

Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations\nexhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented\ncounterparts when using RawBoost augmentation.

However, organizations are often reluctant\nto share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated\nlearning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local\ndata while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a\npotential solution.

        "abstract": "Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that\nundermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove\nsensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten\" information remains\nprecariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root\ncause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual\ndata points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss\nlandscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can\ndrastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks\nexploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate\nthe steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly\nrecovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical\nrobustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To\naddress this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided\noptimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via\nneighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses\nadversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering\nfeedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through\ngradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that\nour method is significantly more robust against both relearning and\njailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance."

Existing\nattacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily\ntarget vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD\nsystems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)\nAdversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital\nlevel. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage\nAttack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on\noptimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate\nphysically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization\nacross different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the\nobserved vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA\nintroduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational\ndiscrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various\nVLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing\nstate-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\\% in 3-P metrics).

As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal\nperformance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in\nprompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier\nPrompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature\nextraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality\nFusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts\nthrough multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature\nextraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.\nThen, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency\ndomain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and\nunderstanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,\nunlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we\nuse combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality\nprompt.

In this paper, we propose\na novel framework, called Dual-level Defense Routing or DDeR, that can\nautonomously select appropriate routers to integrate specific defense experts,\nthereby adapting to evolving adversarial attacks. Concretely, the first-level\ndefense routing comprises multiple defense experts and routers, with each\nrouter dynamically selecting and combining suitable experts to process attacked\nfeatures. Routers are independently incremented as continuous adversarial\ntraining progresses, and their selections are guided by an Adversarial Sentinel\nNetwork (ASN) in the second-level defense routing. To compensate for the\ninability to test due to the independence of routers, we further present a\nPseudo-task Substitution Training (PST) strategy, which leverages\ndistributional discrepancy in data to facilitate inter-router communication\nwithout storing historical data.

Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions.

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising solutions for\nrobotic manipulation, yet their robustness to real-world physical variations\nremains critically underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the\nfirst unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA\nmodels by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous\noptimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness\npresents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse\nphysical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining\nevaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios\nwithout prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address\nthe first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical\ndomains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination\nvariations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that\ndisrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a\ncontinuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical\nvariations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of\nworst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models\nacross multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types\ntrigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to\n97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks. Our findings expose critical gaps between\ncontrolled laboratory success and unpredictable deployment readiness, while the\nEva-VLA framework provides a practical pathway for hardening VLA-based robotic\nmanipulation models against real-world deployment challenges."

However, existing works are not generic with limited\ndetection types and effectiveness due to imbalanced samples, while the emerging\nLLM technologies, which show its potentials in generalization, have two key\nproblems impeding its application in this task: hard digestion of compiled-code\ninputs, especially those with task-specific logic, and hard assessment of LLMs'\ncertainty in their binary answers, i.e., yes-or-no answers. Therefore, we\npropose a generic adversarial smart contracts detection framework FinDet, which\nleverages LLMs with two enhancements addressing above two problems. FinDet\ntakes as input only the EVM-bytecode contracts and identifies adversarial ones\namong them with high balanced accuracy. The first enhancement extracts concise\nsemantic intentions and high-level behavioral logic from the low-level bytecode\ninputs, unleashing the LLM reasoning capability restricted by the task input.\nThe second enhancement probes and measures the LLM uncertainty to its\nmulti-round answering to the same query, improving the LLM answering robustness\nfor binary classifications required by the task output.

Recent AVS methods have demonstrated\nsignificant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain\ncontradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering\nnoise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in\nvisual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper\nperspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and\nrecomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware\nAudio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:\nFrequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal\nConsistency (SCMC) module.

This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by\nhonest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this\nwork, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task\nby dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The\ninner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples,\nensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the\nbackdoor.

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe\nsecurity threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform\nlabel flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt\nthe global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a\nnovel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse\nadversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA\ncombines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of\nclients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based\ngeometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client\nbased on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering\nof suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients,\ncountering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine\nfailures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+\nrecords) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse\nadversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves\nrobust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on\nNF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum,\nTrimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further\ndemonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the\nanomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%,\nrespectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach.\nThis demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated\nlearning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions."

In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive\nevaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated\nunderwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images\nfrom DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also\nanalyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges,\nand color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall\nperformance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and\ntexture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images.\nClass imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3)\nimage counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance,\nwhile object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we\nevaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection,\nwhich improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and\nfine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced\ndomains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong\npotential for domain adaptation, respectively.

In this work, we identify critical mis-pricings in existing\nrollup transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) that allow for two powerful attacks.\nFirstly, an adversary can saturate the L2's DA batch capacity with\ncompute-light data-heavy transactions, forcing low-gas transaction batches that\nenable both L2 DoS attacks, and finality-delay attacks. Secondly, by crafting\nprover killer transactions that maximize proving cycles relative to the gas\ncharges, an adversary can effectively stall proof generation, delaying finality\nby hours and inflicting prover-side economic losses to the rollup at a minimal\ncost.\n  We analyze the above attack vectors across the major Ethereum rollups,\nquantifying adversarial costs and protocol losses. We find that the first\nattack enables periodic DoS on rollups, lasting up to 30 minutes, at a cost\nbelow 2 ETH for most rollups.

        "abstract": "Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation\nas a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches.\nHowever, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty\nestimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions.\nIn this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of\nuncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the\nrelationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries\nand noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are\ndesigned. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and\nhuman interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for\nevaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed\nmethod can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the\ninterpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

However, these models may also be\nabused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.\nExisting jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving\npotential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,\ntext-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In\nresponse to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling\nAttack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic\ncomponents of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:\nfirstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe\nprompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that\ncan bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that\ntrigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into\nnatural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model\nto modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic\nconsistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,\nthe visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to\nguide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content."

Action-based video object segmentation addresses this\nby linking segmentation with action semantics, but it depends on large-scale\nannotations and prompts that are costly, inconsistent, and prone to multimodal\nnoise such as imprecise masks and referential ambiguity. To date, this\nchallenge remains unexplored. In this work, we take the first step by studying\naction-based video object segmentation under label noise, focusing on two\nsources: textual prompt noise (category flips and within-category noun\nsubstitutions) and mask annotation noise (perturbed object boundaries to mimic\nimprecise supervision). Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce\ntwo types of label noises for the action-based video object segmentation task.\nSecond, we build up the first action-based video object segmentation under a\nlabel noise benchmark ActiSeg-NL and adapt six label-noise learning strategies\nto this setting, and establish protocols for evaluating them under textual,\nboundary, and mixed noise. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking\nnoise types to failure modes and robustness gains, and we introduce a Parallel\nMask Head Mechanism (PMHM) to address mask annotation noise. Qualitative\nevaluations further reveal characteristic failure modes, including boundary\nleakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional\nidentity substitutions under textual flips. Our comparative analysis reveals\nthat different learning strategies exhibit distinct robustness profiles,\ngoverned by a foreground-background trade-off where some achieve balanced\nperformance while others prioritize foreground accuracy at the cost of\nbackground precision.

Existing defenses often assume that CPI\nattacks are non-adaptive to the specific ML model they are targeting. This\nassumption overlooks a key characteristic of real-world adversaries: their\nresponsiveness, i.e., adversaries' ability to dynamically adjust their attack\nmodels based on the information of the target and its defenses. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a novel defense method that explicitly accounts for\nthe responsive nature of real-world adversaries via two methodological\ninnovations: a novel Responsive CPI attack and an attack-defense arms race\nframework. The former emulates the responsive behaviors of adversaries in the\nreal world, and the latter iteratively enhances both the target and attack\nmodels, ultimately producing a secure ML model that is robust against\nresponsive CPI attacks. Furthermore, we propose and integrate a novel\napproximate strategy into our defense, which addresses a critical computational\nbottleneck of defense methods and improves defense efficiency.

Despite significant advancements in VSR\nover recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world\nvisual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and\npose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local\nIntegrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon\ntwo key insights: (i) learning an initial coarse alignment between visual\nfeatures across varying conditions and corresponding speech content facilitates\nthe subsequent learning of precise visual-to-speech mappings in challenging\nenvironments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain local regions (e.g.,\nnon-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues for lip reading than\nglobal features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path feature extraction\narchitecture that integrates both global and local features within a two-stage\nprogressive learning framework. In the first stage, the model learns to align\nboth global and local visual features with corresponding acoustic speech units\nusing easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a coarse yet\nsemantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a Contextual\nEnhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with relevant\nglobal context across both spatial and temporal dimensions, refining the coarse\nrepresentations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our framework uniquely\nexploits discriminative local regions through a progressive learning strategy,\ndemonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and\nconsistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks.

However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples\nsometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking\nthe fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster\nProblem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification\nperformance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view\nsemi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI.

By stacking all\nsimilarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure\nfrom the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor\nlearning.

        "abstract": "Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to\nheterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation\nmodels (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in\npredicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment\nresponse and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a\nneuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,\nenabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining\ncross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones\n(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class\nimbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers\n(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),\ncontinuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1\nwild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular\nprediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean\nbalanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with\nthe largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to\n0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).\nFor survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647\nto 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral\nregions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields\nmore site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon\nmarkers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for\nprospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional\nsignals to advance precision neuro-oncology."

        "abstract": "Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative\nalgorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to\nsolve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering\ndata from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in\ncritical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial\nrobustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid\ntheoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the\npresence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we\nstudy the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with\n$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.\nParticularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized\nunfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial\nRademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial\ngeneralization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with\nrespect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical\nanalysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further\npresent a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating\nour derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the\nfamily's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial\nrobustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks."

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR\nwhile preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and\npreviously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to\nreassess the shared instructional prompts."

Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization\n(TERM) extends ERM by introducing an exponential tilt hyperparameter $t$ to\nbalance average-case accuracy with worst-case fairness and robustness. However,\nin online or streaming settings where data arrive one sample at a time, the\nclassical TERM objective degenerates to standard ERM, losing tilt sensitivity.\nWe address this limitation by proposing an online TERM formulation that removes\nthe logarithm from the classical objective, preserving tilt effects without\nadditional computational or memory overhead. This formulation enables a\ncontinuous trade-off controlled by $t$, smoothly interpolating between ERM ($t\n\\to 0$), fairness emphasis ($t > 0$), and robustness to outliers ($t < 0$). We\nempirically validate online TERM on two representative streaming tasks: robust\nlinear regression with adversarial outliers and minority-class detection in\nbinary classification. Our results demonstrate that negative tilting\neffectively suppresses outlier influence, while positive tilting improves\nrecall with minimal impact on precision, all at per-sample computational cost\nequivalent to ERM.

To assess this, we\nintroduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along\nwith a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different\nmodel families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that\ncurrent LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models\n(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously\nsuccessful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)\ncan fail more than 20% of the time.

Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks.

The Sentinel Agents successfully\ndetected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the\nproposed monitoring approach.

        "abstract": "Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into\na shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception\nand decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to\nadversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for\nsafety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within\nCLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding\nmodest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a\ntwo-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust\nunified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on\nclean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages\ncross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between\nclean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise\ndistributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,\nAudio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the\nLanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy\nand norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without\nsacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer\nmulti-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,\nand other autonomy settings."

This paper steps toward a general\nframework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain\nsetting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible\ninformation asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary.\nOur analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining\nboth the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average\nreward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation\ncharacterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide\nsufficient conditions ensuring solutions' existence.

However, storing data on a central server raises concerns about\nsecurity and privacy. To address this issue, a federated learning architecture\nhas been proposed. In federated learning, each client trains a local model\nusing its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the\ncentral server. The server then combines the received models using federated\naggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is\ndistributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical\nmanner. Although preventing data from leaving the clients enhances security,\ncertain concerns still remain. Attackers can perform inference attacks on the\nobtained models to approximate the training dataset, potentially causing data\nleakage. In this study, differential privacy was applied to address the\naforementioned security vulnerability, and a performance analysis was\nconducted. The Data-Unaware Classification Based on Association (duCBA)\nalgorithm was used as the federated aggregation method. Differential privacy\nwas implemented on the data using the Randomized Response technique, and the\ntrade-off between security and performance was examined under different epsilon\nvalues. As the epsilon value decreased, the model accuracy declined, and class\nprediction imbalances were observed. This indicates that higher levels of\nprivacy do not always lead to practical outcomes and that the balance between\nsecurity and performance must be carefully considered."
