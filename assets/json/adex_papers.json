        "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric\nauthentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as\nintegral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of\nthese systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters\ngain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature\nreveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed\nto counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics\nemploying deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.\nThis study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models\naddressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By\ninnovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated\nwith genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from\nreplicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across\nfive diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and\nenvironmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over\nexisting systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average\naccuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical\ninsights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a\nmore nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are\nprofound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but\nalso instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on\nsecure access."

Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally\ndesigned for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the\nadversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the\nbest of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency\ninformation for time-series adversarial attacks.

This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging\nCLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the\ndesign and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating\nthe embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal\nrepresentations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues\nindicative of bona-fide or attack samples.

Using this\nnew evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with\nmultiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math\nproblems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative\nLLMs and examine their robustness.

Critically, collecting\nsuch large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in\nreal-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies\nentropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal\ndata (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,\nconducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.\nThis enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while\nrequiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that\nintegrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared\nmanifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound.

        "abstract": "The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture\nhas enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the\nincreased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel\nsecurity challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised\nShared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In\nparticular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing\nsubtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used\nby traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These\nUnicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures\nin anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders,\nwhich are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate\nthe use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN\narchitecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps\nmaintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing\nmanipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy\nrequires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to\nadversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use\ntheir adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy,\nalthough this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs\nachieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for\nNear-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments."

Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large\nface datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.\nHowever, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in\nmultiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates\ndatabase management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face\nfor dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising\nsignificant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a\nnovel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.\nFirst, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to\nsecurely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it\nproposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training\ndata storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial\nrecognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve\nthe privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while\nensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also\nenables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their\npersonal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that\nVOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and\nprivacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

        "abstract": "Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of\ndeepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,\nas their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these\ndefenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.\nThis means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their\nmodels, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense\nnot only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,\nwhich occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To\nachieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).\nBenefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the\nframework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.\nFirst, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a\npoisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an\nattacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to\nprevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus\nensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply\nwhen it is subjected to adversarial retraining.

A standard goal\nin RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an\nadversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the\nprobabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,\nsuch optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value\niteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,\nwhich, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different\nexpected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.\nHence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing\ninspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.\nInstead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,\nwe additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under\ndifferent (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such\na policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE\npolicies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm\nto compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value\niteration.

        "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nagents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms\nbaseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different\ncommunication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and\ncapacity limitations."

To tackle these gaps, we introduce a new AVSR framework\ntermed AD-AVSR based on bidirectional modality enhancement. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce the audio dual-stream encoding strategy to enrich audio\nrepresentations from multiple perspectives and intentionally establish\nasymmetry to support subsequent cross-modal interactions. The enhancement\nprocess involves two key components, Audio-aware Visual Refinement Module for\nenhanced visual representations under audio guidance, and Cross-modal Noise\nSuppression Masking Module which refines audio representations using visual\ncues, collaboratively leading to the closed-loop and bidirectional information\nflow. To further enhance correlation robustness, we adopt a threshold-based\nselection mechanism to filter out irrelevant or weakly correlated audio-visual\npairs.

However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly\ntransferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,\nwithout accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly\ndegrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a\nunified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is\nguided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant\nknowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each\ntransformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These\nforgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To\ndetect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that\nlearns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling\nreliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist\nadversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention\nlayers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by\nadversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the\nadversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean\nimages. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack\nmethods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level\nforgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

        "abstract": "With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they are\nincreasingly applied in areas like intelligent customer service, code\ngeneration, and knowledge management. Natural language (NL) prompts act as the\n``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices\nfor prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines\nand templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P),\nwhich not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles\nfrom software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and\nstrict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a\ndeclarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps\nLLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and\nhigher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on\nLLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into\nCNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we\ndevelop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic\naccuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM\nresponses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that\nCNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the\nfoundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL."

Existing\ndetection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned\nclassifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to\nparaphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work,\nwe propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated\ntext by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our\nmethod is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to\nexhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display\ngreater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two\ncomplementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment\ndistribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering\nand semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five\ndiverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro,\nClaude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its\nsuperiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score\nimprovements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively.

In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel\nframework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining\naccurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation\nof the entire ME sequence as the input.

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting.

To address this, we\npropose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that\nleverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial\nexamples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the\nshared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a\nparametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within\nadversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight\ndomain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using\nminimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.\nUltimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples\nthrough random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific\ndatasets.

This equilibrium is a fixed point\nwhere the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry\nmining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The\nsecurity, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined\nvia a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and\ncontinuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer\nconditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the\nstabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially\ndestabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable\npredictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate\nand price.

        "abstract": "Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing\nprivate training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have\nfocused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study\nto understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To\ntailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel\ntoken-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we\npropose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model\nInversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based\nModel Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive\nexperiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple\ndatasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to\ntraining data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based\nmethods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on\nvocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and\noutperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.\nImportantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack\naccuracy of 75.31\\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in\nVLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released\nVLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become\nincreasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance."

        "abstract": "Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine\nlearning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing\nattention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from\nmultiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering\nperformance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered\napplications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored\ngroup fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit\nregularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between\nsensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this\nassumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In\nthis paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)\nframework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning\nprocess. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally\nremove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the\nresulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we\ntheoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a\nfairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves\nclustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby\nproviding additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive\nexperiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC\nachieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to\nexisting multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods."

There are some key issues in the development\nof crowdsensing such as platform security and privacy protection. As the\ncrowdsensing is usually managed by a centralized platform, centralized\nmanagement will bring various security vulnerabilities and scalability issues.\nTo solve these issues, an effective reputation-based partition scheme (RSPC) is\nproposed in this article. The partition scheme calculates the optimal partition\nsize by combining the node reputation value and divides the node into several\ndisjoint partitions according to the node reputation value. By selecting the\nappropriate partition size, RSPC provides a mechanism to ensure that each\npartition is valid, as long as themaximum permissible threshold for the failed\nnode is observed. At the same time, the RSPC reorganizes the network\nperiodically to avoid partition attacks. In addition, for cross-partition\ntransactions, this paper innovatively proposes a four-stage confirmation\nprotocol to ensure the efficient and safe completion of cross-partition\ntransactions. Finally, experiments show that RSPC improves scalability, low\nlatency, and high throughput for crowdsensing."

This study\nperforms a comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attack methods to identify\nand analyze their potential vulnerabilities. We formulate the diagnosis process\nas a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the patient responses\nand unasked questions, and the action is either to ask a question or to make a\ndiagnosis. We implemented six prevailing major attack methods, including the\nFast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini &\nWagner Attack (C&W) attack, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), DeepFool, and\nAutoAttack, with seven epsilon values each. To ensure the generated adversarial\nexamples remain clinically plausible, we developed a comprehensive medical\nvalidation framework consisting of 247 medical constraints, including\nphysiological bounds, symptom correlations, and conditional medical\nconstraints. We achieved a 97.6% success rate in generating clinically\nplausible adversarial samples. We performed our experiment on the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/), which\nconsists of 182,630 samples, to predict the participant's 4-year mortality\nrate. We evaluated our attacks on the AdaptiveFS framework proposed in\narXiv:2004.00994. Our results show that adversarial attacks could significantly\nimpact the diagnostic accuracy, with attack success rates ranging from 33.08%\n(FGSM) to 64.70% (AutoAttack).

        "abstract": "In this paper, we endeavor to address the challenges of backdoor attacks\ncountermeasures in black-box scenarios, thereby fortifying the security of\ninference under MLaaS. We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new\nperspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into:\nhigh-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and\nlow-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a\nprogressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these triggers from the\nmost conspicuous to the most subtle, without requiring model access. First, for\nHVTs, which create the most significant local semantic distortions, we identify\nand eliminate them by detecting these salient differences. We then restore the\npatched area to mitigate the adverse impact of such removal process. The\nlocalized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs,\nwhich globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned\ninput as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally\ntreat the benign features as \"noise\". This formulation allows us to reconstruct\nSVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign \"noise\"\nfeatures. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed\ntrigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we\nintroduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM\nto restore any collateral impact on clean features. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Compared\nwith baselines, BDFirewall reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average\nof 33.25%, improving poisoned sample accuracy (PA) by 29.64%, and achieving up\nto a 111x speedup in inference time.

Executing highly dynamic maneuvers\nrequires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the\nhardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and\nenvironmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube\nmodel predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and\nrobustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive\ncontroller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To\nachieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we\ndesign imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural\nnetwork, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of\ncentral nervous system and motor neurons.

        "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible\nvision loss, making effective prognosis crucial for timely intervention. In\nthis work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD\nprognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates\ncolor fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At\nits core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that\nleverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the\nmodel to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with\nclinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis\nmethods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing\nmodels that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local\ninformation, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and\nsimultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular\nchanges. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale\nfusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different\nresolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818\ncolor fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic\nvariables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the\nprogression of AMD. Notably, combining this biomarker with other existing\nvariables yields promising improvements in detecting high-risk AMD patients at\nearly stages. These findings highlight the potential of our multi-modal\nframework to facilitate more precise and proactive management of AMD."

For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available.

This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation\nproblem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its\ninvestment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks,\nand reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes.\nThis encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the\nobservation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this\nuncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate\nhow the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment\nin the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be\nachieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive\nresources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with\nhigher sensor quality.

        "abstract": "Smart contract upgrades are increasingly common due to their flexibility in\nmodifying deployed contracts, such as fixing bugs or adding new\nfunctionalities. Meanwhile, upgrades compromise the immutability of contracts,\nintroducing significant security concerns. While existing research has explored\nthe security impacts of contract upgrades, these studies are limited in\ncollection of upgrade behaviors and identification of insecurities.\n  To address these limitations, we conduct a comprehensive study on the\ninsecurities of upgrade behaviors. First, we build a dataset containing 83,085\nupgraded contracts and 20,902 upgrade chains. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst large-scale dataset about upgrade behaviors, revealing their diversity\nand exposing gaps in public disclosure. Next, we develop a taxonomy of\ninsecurities based on 37 real-world security incidents, categorizing eight\ntypes of upgrade risks and providing the first complete view of upgrade-related\ninsecurities. Finally, we survey public awareness of these risks and existing\nmitigations. Our findings show that four types of security risks are overlooked\nby the public and lack mitigation measures. We detect these upgrade risks\nthrough a preliminary study, identifying 31,407 related issues - a finding that\nraises significant concerns."

Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,\nincluding passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server\nproactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations\nin practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data\ndistributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive\ndefenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on\nbackdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new\nproactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor\ncollision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors\nsignificantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by\nevaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased\nduring local training rather than retained.

We identify\nthis as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be\npreferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or\naccess to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we\npropose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning\nframework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically\nvalid tool metadata through iterative optimization.

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with\nfeature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens\nin a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel\ntrigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering\ndeeper insights into adversarial attack patterns.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nBackdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial\nKnowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense\neffectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned\ndata. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned\ndata, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small\nset of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is\ndesigned to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a\ncycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean\nand identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream\nattacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without\nsignificantly reducing the CACC.

Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be\ndifferent approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the\nproblem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep\nautoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network\ntraffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the\neasiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different\nstory. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user\nactivity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of\nharmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a\nthreat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw\nacross the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex\nmodel. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data\nbehaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine.

        "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly\nintegral to IoT-based environments, enabling realtime visual computing.\nHowever, the limited computational capacity of these devices has motivated the\nadoption of collaborative DNN inference, where the IoT device offloads part of\nthe inference-related computation to a remote server. Such offloading often\nrequires dynamic DNN partitioning information to be exchanged among the\nparticipants over an unsecured network or via relays/hops, leading to novel\nprivacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose AdVAR-DNN, an adversarial\nvariational autoencoder (VAE)-based misclassification attack, leveraging\nclassifiers to detect model information and a VAE to generate untraceable\nmanipulated samples, specifically designed to compromise the collaborative\ninference process. AdVAR-DNN attack uses the sensitive information exchange\nvulnerability of collaborative DNN inference and is black-box in nature in\nterms of having no prior knowledge about the DNN model and how it is\npartitioned. Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs\non the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms\nof high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection."

        "abstract": "Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.\nExisting open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,\ndetecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel\nattenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate\nfeatures and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding\ninformation useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage\nthis overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines\nboth the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We\nprovide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the\nlikelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To\ndetermine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features\nto COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both\npre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard\nproduct features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in\na large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,\niNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple\nmodern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments\ndemonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures\nand significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating\npreviously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition\ncapabilities."

The\nadversary has complete access to listen/read the ciphertext without tampering\nwith the communication line. We provide an unconditionally secure encryption\nscheme to exchange messages among devices in the system. The main idea behind\nthe scheme is to provide secret keys to exchange messages using a random binary\nmatrix that is securely shared among all the devices, and pair-wise random\nsecret keys established between each pair of devices attempting to communicate\nbefore the mission. The scheme is implemented by using finite group modular\naddition. We show that the scheme is absolutely semantically secure, i.e., the\nscheme guarantees that an adversary with unbounded computational power cannot\nget even one bit of information about a message, except for an exponentially\nsmall probability in a security parameter. Besides that, we show that even if\nthe random binary matrix is revealed to the adversary, the provided scheme is\ncomputationally secure against the key recovery attack."

Existing defense\nstrategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever\nrobustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security\nguarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).\nOur framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual\nprotection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that\nonly authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,\nwe rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a\ncomputational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of\nstate-of-the-art attacks.

In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that\nmaximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial\nperturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,\nincluding the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous\nknowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel\nloss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.\nExtensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by\nover $90\\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%\nsuccess rate on our real-world vehicle testbed.

Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection\ncapabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English\ndatasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese\ncontext. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal\nframework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated\nwith directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive\nthree-stage training paradigm.

Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios\nrequires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and\nantithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor\nmodel (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density\nanalysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize\nplausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples\nthrough a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN,\nwe use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal\ninformation from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the\nGDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible\nwaveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated\nperformance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power\nscenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical\ncharacteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM\nwith a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the\nGAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors."

This leads to the large-scale adversarial\npatch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive\nanalyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against\nnaturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly\nbelieved high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can\nbe used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average\nprecision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch\ndetection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)\nAdaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with\ncomplex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.\nWe hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch\nattacks/defenses and advancing their design.
