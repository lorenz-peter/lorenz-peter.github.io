        "abstract": "This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to\nguide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to\ndesired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired\nprompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust\nactivations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows\nfor fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without\nmodifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our\nsteering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original\nVLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise\nactivation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring\npre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.\nFurthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a\nmultimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and\nevaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing\nintervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for\nVLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through\nactivation engineering."

This\napproach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant\ntext, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise.\nThese two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic\ninformation to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping.

There is no\nsystematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against\nmodel inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face\nauthentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of\nbest-effort solutions.\n  In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong\ndefense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the\ncryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy\nextractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication.

Our\napproach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to\nmodify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing\nresearch against transformer-based models for network traffic classification;\nand (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic\nperturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against\ntransformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend\nagainst transformer-based traffic classifiers.

Perception computing\nis typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale\ndeep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous\nstudies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,\nquantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,\nthese methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant\ndrop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address\nthese challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,\ncalled EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization\nstrategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.\nFirstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational\nconsumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define\nthem as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian\noptimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation\nwhile maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in\nvarious traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to\ndistinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust\ndecision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning\nand design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of\nperturbed perception results.

Although over-approximation\nmethods have shown success in neural network verification to address this\nchallenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.\nFurthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight\nlocal Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.\nOriginally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was\nproposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and\ncomplete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity\ngrafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than\nreducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require\nrelaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the\n$l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear\nactivation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a\ntighter local Lipschitz constant.

Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level\noptimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space\nof a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves\nsignificantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on\nboth the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive\nbaselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.\nWe reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under\nstrict semantic and grammatical constraints.

Its successor, SAM2, has attracted\nsignificant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video\nsegmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear\nwhether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this\npaper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and\nSAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural\ndifferences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement\nacross consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the\nfirst cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual\nsemantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a\ntarget-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly\nassigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For\neffectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a\nUAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the\nsemantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six\ndatasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method for SAM2.

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently.

To address this\nproblem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal\ntransport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by\nrestoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in\nthe feature space.

It drives\nefficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by\nassigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation\nmethods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating\nchanges in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as\nopposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different\npatterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods\nbased on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when\nthe validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware\nmethods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical\ndeployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),\na plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an\nID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral\napproximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and\nOOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then\nestimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via\nperturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV\nplugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional\ntraining loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and\nstable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining\ncomputationally lightweight.

To tackle the issues,\nthis paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction\n(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,\nadaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,\nwe propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate\nthe unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language\nreferences.

Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial\nfine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot\nsettings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP\nadversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view\nvariations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective\ntest-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic\nconsistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and\nmulti-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the\ntarget embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning\nperturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under\nadversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play\ninference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack\nsettings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP\nwhile maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs\nfor further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing\nan adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to\nbroader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP."

        "abstract": "Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a\nfundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic\npatterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing\nmethods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures\nor graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN\nlearning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs\noften suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain\nshifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal\nevolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time\nperiods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's\nrobustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical\nobservations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test\ngraph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it\nin heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance\nof pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training\nor update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural\ntransformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.\nSpecifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,\nfacilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the\nconfidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine\nbenchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate\nthat GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with\nimprovements of up to 10.92%.

Furthermore, most defenses are\ndeveloped to secure deep neural networks or binary classifiers. However,\ntraditional multiclass classifiers need attention to be secure from data\npoisoning attacks, as these models are significant in developing multi-modal\napplications. Therefore, this paper proposes SecureLearn, a two-layer\nattack-agnostic defense to defend multiclass models from poisoning attacks. It\ncomprises two components of data sanitization and a new feature-oriented\nadversarial training. To ascertain the effectiveness of SecureLearn, we\nproposed a 3D evaluation matrix with three orthogonal dimensions: data\npoisoning attack, data sanitization and adversarial training. Benchmarking\nSecureLearn in a 3D matrix, a detailed analysis is conducted at different\npoisoning levels (10%-20%), particularly analysing accuracy, recall, F1-score,\ndetection and correction rates, and false discovery rate. The experimentation\nis conducted for four ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree\n(DT), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), trained with\nthree public datasets, against three poisoning attacks and compared with two\nexisting mitigations. Our results highlight that SecureLearn is effective\nagainst the provided attacks. SecureLearn has strengthened resilience and\nadversarial robustness of traditional multiclass models and neural networks,\nconfirming its generalization beyond algorithm-specific defenses. It\nconsistently maintained accuracy above 90%, recall and F1-score above 75%. For\nneural networks, SecureLearn achieved 97% recall and F1-score against all\nselected poisoning attacks."

To solve this critical issue, we propose\na novel secure communication framework for LAWNs where the selected UAVs within\na swarm function as a virtual antenna array (VAA), complemented by intelligent\nreflecting surface (IRS) to create a robust defense against eavesdropping\nattacks. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that\nsimultaneously maximizes the secrecy rate while minimizing the maximum sidelobe\nlevel and total energy consumption, requiring joint optimization of UAV\nexcitation current weights, flight trajectories, and IRS phase shifts. This\nproblem presents significant difficulties due to the dynamic nature of the\nsystem and heterogeneous components.

To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that\nstrongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:\n(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal\ndirection, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,\nand (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal.

In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks,\nwhere adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services.\nThese attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats\nto revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking\nsolution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model\ntraceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study\nthe vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\\delta$-STEAL, a\nnovel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark\ndetectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\\delta$-STEAL\ninjects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during\nfine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP)\nguarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect\noutputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise\nto these pairs, $\\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it\ndifficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used,\nthereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that\n$\\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of\nup to $96.95\\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model\nutility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack\neffectiveness and model utility.

Defending against novel jailbreaks\nrepresents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract\nand compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with\nLLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates.

LI is preferentially engaged in low-\nand medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.\nWhen combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal\ndiscrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant\nmodules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal\nlearning in complex contexts."

However, most existing watermarking algorithms rely on heuristic\ngreen/red token list designs, as directly optimizing the list design with\ntechniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) comes with several challenges.\nFirst, desirable watermarking involves multiple criteria, i.e., detectability,\ntext quality, robustness against removal attacks, and security against spoofing\nattacks.

By exploiting correlations between facial\nand vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass\nindustry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and\nMicrosoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are\nfar easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering\nthe barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core\nresearch questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors\nreliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and\n(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection\nwithout overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators\nsuch as SpeechT5.\n  Our study makes three contributions.

        "abstract": "Ensuring secure and efficient multi-user (MU) transmission is critical for\nvehicular communication systems. Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered\nconsiderable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.\nHowever, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those\nbased on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to\nreference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal\nmultiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code\nmultiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high\ncomputational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook\ndesigns. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain\nnon-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for\nvehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is\ndesigned to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline\ntraining, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference\nsignal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction\narchitecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain\ninformation of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic\nchannels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior\nperformance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit\nerror rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower\ncomputational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided\nschemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular\ncommunications."

Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained\ninter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms\nsuch as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically\nrely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level\ncross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse\nmolecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement\nframework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph\nthat integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of\ninter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is\nthe potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling\nlong-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure\nconsistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the\nglobal structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively\nlearn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.\npatterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI\ntypes.

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each\nhigher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time\nseries. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that\nthe forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the\nforecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal\nreconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,\nhowever, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from\nfinite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance\nmatrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nrobust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for\nuncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an\nuncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a\nreconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error\nover this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a\nsemidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than\nexisting hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of\nintegrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process."

In\nthis work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating\nInternal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external\ncorrection to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's\nown reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent\nthrough a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract\ncore semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety\nawareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust\ndecision-making.

Crucially, it achieves\nthis while preserving model performance on benign tasks and incurring minimal\ncomputational overhead.

        "abstract": "Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional\nvideo is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background\nmotion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase\nframework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable\nlatent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a\nspatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to\nfocus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,\nenabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon\nvideo prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the\nmost physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and\nrefine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to\nenforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments\non five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including\nchaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic\ndimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background\nperturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among\nCNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that\ncombining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields\npredictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable."

        "abstract": "Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries\nuse fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain\nunauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection\n(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to\nmitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL\nmodels function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The\npurpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about\nthe reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual\nexplanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of\nDL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric\nimage is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel\ntechnique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the\ndecisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve\nDL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their\nbehavior.

The framework was trained on thin section\nsamples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,\nsimultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a\nsingle unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network\nprinciples and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone\nfabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures\nwith anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control\n(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.\nMorphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network\ncharacteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and\ntortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological\ntolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior\nrepresentativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to\n36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images.

The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop.

        "abstract": "Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local\nlinearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators\nsuch as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning\nfunction-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but\nthey suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing\non inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial\nteacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical\nsolver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling\nloop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to\nexpand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables\ngradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining.

To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores.

Our framework formalizes evaluation\nthrough four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,\nTool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for\nwasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.\nAgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each\ndesigned to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows.

Unlike traditional RAN\nwhere the RAN data and its usage is restricted within proprietary and\nmonolithic RAN equipment, the O-RAN architecture opens up access to RAN data\nvia RAN intelligent controllers (RICs), to third-party machine learning (ML)\npowered applications - rApps and xApps - to optimize RAN operations.\nConsequently, a major focus has been placed on leveraging RAN data to unlock\ngreater efficiency gains. However, there is an increasing recognition that RAN\ndata access to apps could become a source of vulnerability and be exploited by\nmalicious actors. Motivated by this, we carry out a comprehensive investigation\nof data vulnerabilities on both xApps and rApps, respectively hosted in Near-\nand Non-real-time (RT) RIC components of O-RAN. We qualitatively analyse the\nO-RAN security mechanisms and limitations for xApps and rApps, and consider a\nthreat model informed by this analysis. We design a viable and effective\nblack-box evasion attack strategy targeting O-RAN RIC Apps while accounting for\nthe stringent timing constraints and attack effectiveness. The strategy employs\nfour key techniques: the model cloning algorithm, input-specific perturbations,\nuniversal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), and targeted UAPs. This strategy\ntargets ML models used by both xApps and rApps within the O-RAN system, aiming\nto degrade network performance. We validate the effectiveness of the designed\nevasion attack strategy and quantify the scale of performance degradation using\na real-world O-RAN testbed and emulation environments. Evaluation is conducted\nusing the Interference Classification xApp and the Power Saving rApp as\nrepresentatives for near-RT and non-RT RICs.

Existing\nUAV-assisted O-RAN approaches often overlook the joint optimization of\nsecurity, latency, and energy efficiency in dynamic environments. This paper\nproposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic\nresource allocation in UAV relays, explicitly addressing these trade-offs.

        "abstract": "Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt\ndetection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease\nmodeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate\nspatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on\nmultiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering\nmethods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in\nlinear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover\nintrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major\nlimitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,\nemphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model\nlong-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to\n4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC\n(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model\ncombining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying\ndiscriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal\nintegrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing\nparameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based\nself-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global\ndependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations.
