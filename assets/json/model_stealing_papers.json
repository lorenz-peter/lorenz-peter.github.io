        "abstract": "Previous work on home router security has shown that using system calls to train a transformer-based language model built on a BERT-style encoder using contrastive learning is effective in detecting several types of malware, but the performance remains limited at low false positive rates. In this work, we demonstrate that using a high-fidelity eBPF-based system call sensor, together with contrastive augmented learning (which introduces controlled mutations of negative samples), improves detection performance at a low false positive rate. In addition, we introduce a network packet abstraction language that enables the creation of a pipeline similar to network packet data, and we show that network behavior provides complementary detection signals-yielding improved performance for network-focused malware at low false positive rates. Lastly, we implement these methods in an online router anomaly detection framework to validate the approach in an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment environment."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00342v1",
        "abstract": "In aerodynamics, accurately modeling subsonic compressible flow over airfoils is critical for aircraft design. However, solving the governing nonlinear perturbation velocity potential equation presents computational challenges. Traditional approaches often rely on linearized equations or finite, truncated domains, which introduce non-negligible errors and limit applicability in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the full nonlinear compressible potential equation in an unbounded (infinite) domain. We address the unbounded-domain and convergence challenges inherent in standard PINNs by incorporating a coordinate transformation and embedding physical asymptotic constraints directly into the network architecture. Furthermore, we employ a Multi-Stage PINN (MS-PINN) approach to iteratively minimize residuals, achieving solution accuracy approaching machine precision. We validate this framework by simulating flow over circular and elliptical geometries, comparing our results against traditional finite-domain and linearized solutions. Our findings quantify the noticeable discrepancies introduced by domain truncation and linearization, particularly at higher Mach numbers, and demonstrate that this new framework is a robust, high-fidelity tool for computational fluid dynamics."

        "abstract": "Achieving consistent and high-fidelity geometry and appearance reconstruction of 3D digital humans from a single RGB image is inherently a challenging task. Existing studies typically resort to decoupled pipelines for geometry estimation and appearance synthesis, often hindering unified reconstruction and causing inconsistencies. This paper introduces \\textbf{JGA-LBD}, a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and appearance into a joint latent representation and formulates the generation process as bridge diffusion. Observing that directly integrating heterogeneous input conditions (e.g., depth maps, SMPL models) leads to substantial training difficulties, we unify all conditions into the 3D Gaussian representations, which can be further compressed into a unified latent space through a shared sparse variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the specialized form of bridge diffusion enables to start with a partial observation of the target latent code and solely focuses on inferring the missing components. Finally, a dedicated decoding module extracts the complete 3D human geometric structure and renders novel views from the inferred latent representation. Experiments demonstrate that JGA-LBD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both geometry fidelity and appearance quality, including challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances feature learning under low-data conditions. The augmented detector significantly outperforms models trained on limited real data alone and approaches the performance benchmarks of fully supervised training, proving the efficacy of pseudo-IR synthesis as a robust augmentation strategy for industrial inspection."

        "abstract": "Vector quantization (VQ) is a prevalent and fundamental technique that discretizes continuous feature vectors by approximating them using a codebook. As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook."

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\u03bc$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device.

We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications."

While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization."

        "abstract": "With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches."

By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education."

While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension."

To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization.

While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models."

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT."

        "abstract": "Accurate modeling of scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor-edge dynamics is vital for designing plasma-facing components in fusion devices. High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices."

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents."

Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss.

In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting."

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods."

Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

In the joint prediction task involving four sequential conditions--curing and cooling, storage, overloading, and ignition--GrainGNet reduces the mean squared error by 62.8% compared to the baseline graph U-Net model, with only a 5.2% increase in parameter count and an approximately sevenfold improvement in training efficiency. Furthermore, in the high-strain regions of debonding seams, the prediction error is further reduced by 33% compared to the second-best method, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity approach to evaluate motor structural safety."

While some of these critical vulnerabilities have been uncovered through cumbersome manual effort, building an automated and systematic vulnerability detection framework for real-world post-silicon processors remains a challenge.\n  In this paper, we present Fuzzilicon, the first post-silicon fuzzing framework for real-world x86 CPUs that brings deep introspection into the microcode and microarchitectural layers. Fuzzilicon automates the discovery of vulnerabilities that were previously only detectable through extensive manual reverse engineering, and bridges the visibility gap by introducing microcode-level instrumentation. At the core of Fuzzilicon is a novel technique for extracting feedback directly from the processor's microarchitecture, enabled by reverse-engineering Intel's proprietary microcode update interface. We develop a minimally intrusive instrumentation method and integrate it with a hypervisor-based fuzzing harness to enable precise, feedback-guided input generation, without access to Register Transfer Level (RTL).\n  Applied to Intel's Goldmont microarchitecture, Fuzzilicon introduces 5 significant findings, including two previously unknown microcode-level speculative-execution vulnerabilities. Besides, the Fuzzilicon framework automatically rediscover the $\u03bc$Spectre class of vulnerabilities, which were detected manually in the previous work. Fuzzilicon reduces coverage collection overhead by up to 31$\\times$ compared to baseline techniques and achieves 16.27% unique microcode coverage of hookable locations, the first empirical baseline of its kind. As a practical, coverage-guided, and scalable approach to post-silicon fuzzing, Fuzzilicon establishes a new foundation to automate the discovery of complex CPU vulnerabilities."

To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark."

This limitation effectively overlooks \"Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this \"one-run, many-models\" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the \"train once, deploy many\" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines."

        "abstract": "Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance."

We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2.

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

        "abstract": "Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fr\u00e9chet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits."

Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming.

To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing."

Traditional computational approaches often rely on experimentally determined 3D structures, which are scarce and computationally expensive to obtain. This paper introduces DuaDeep-SeqAffinity, a novel sequence-only deep learning framework that predicts affinity scores solely from their amino acid sequences using a dual-stream hybrid architecture. Our approach leverages pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model embeddings, combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local motif detection with Transformer encoders for global contextual representation. A subsequent fusion module integrates these multi-faceted features, which are then passed to a fully connected network for final score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that DuaDeep-SeqAffinity significantly outperforms individual architectural components and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DuaDeep achieved a superior Pearson correlation of 0.688, an R^2 of 0.460, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.737, surpassing single-branch variants ESM-CNN and ESM-Transformer. Notably, the model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.890, outperforming sequence-only benchmarks and even surpassing structure-sequence hybrid models. These findings prove that high-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture essential binding patterns typically reserved for structural modeling. By eliminating the reliance on 3D structures, DuaDeep-SeqAffinity provides a highly scalable and efficient solution for high-throughput screening of vast sequence libraries, significantly accelerating the therapeutic discovery pipeline."

To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities.

This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability. We additionally apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities, ensuring reliable risk estimation for downstream decision support.

We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $\u03c3=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs.

        "abstract": "High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios."

While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A \"running ahead\" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs."

To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference."

The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance.

However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets."

        "abstract": "In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research."

        "abstract": "Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint."

        "abstract": "Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings."

This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. We further employ DPO to better align outputs with human perceptual preferences. Experiments on Libri2Mix show that GenTSE surpasses previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency."

Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps.

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR based perception to support safety critical control functions such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles."

        "abstract": "As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective."

Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing."

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios."

Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the \"synthesis cliff\" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures."

However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP."

        "abstract": "While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills."

Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence."

        "abstract": "Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

        "abstract": "Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support."

        "abstract": "Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject."

Interestingly, our study uncovers a highly inspiring and rarely explored correspondence between an encoder's feature spectrum and its functional role: semantic encoders primarily capture low-frequency components that encode abstract meaning, whereas pixel encoders additionally retain high-frequency information that conveys fine-grained detail. This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks validate that our UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance."

Due to limitations in available data and increased learning complexity, previous methods tend to ignore hand motions, limiting the realism and expressivity of the interactions. Additionally, current diffusion-based approaches generate entire motion sequences simultaneously, limiting their ability to capture the reactive and adaptive nature of human interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce Interact2Ar, the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body, human-human interactions. Interact2Ar incorporates detailed hand kinematics through dedicated parallel branches, enabling high-fidelity full-body generation. Furthermore, we introduce an autoregressive pipeline coupled with a novel memory technique that facilitates adaptation to the inherent variability of human interactions using efficient large context windows. The adaptability of our model enables a series of downstream applications, including temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension beyond dyadic to multi-person scenarios. To validate the generated motions, we introduce a set of robust evaluators and extended metrics designed specifically for assessing full-body interactions. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Interact2Ar."

However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \\textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward. The experiments show that our method outperforms both zero-shot unified models and those with text CoTs in multi-modal generation, demonstrating higher visual context consistency."

Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation."

        "abstract": "Numerical simulation of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is central to scientific and engineering applications, but high-fidelity solvers are often prohibitively expensive for long-horizon or time-critical settings. Neural operator (NO) surrogates offer fast inference across parametric and functional inputs; however, most autoregressive NO frameworks remain vulnerable to compounding errors, and ensemble-averaged metrics provide limited guarantees for individual inference trajectories. In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers."

To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis."

To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Mixing Learning (RMLer), a framework that formulates cross-category concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features serve as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Specifically, we design an MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending cross-category text embeddings. We further introduce visual rewards based on (1) semantic similarity and (2) compositional balance between the fused object and its constituent concepts, optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization. At inference, a selection strategy leverages these rewards to curate the highest-quality fused objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate RMLer's superiority in synthesizing coherent, high-fidelity objects from diverse categories, outperforming existing methods.

The framework calibrates a high-fidelity DT model using only healthy-state data, generates synthetic fault signals for training deep learning classifiers, and employs a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a virtual sensor for flow ripple estimation. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to visualize the decision-making process of neural networks, revealing that large kernels matching the subsequence length in time-domain inputs and small kernels in time-frequency domain inputs enable higher diagnostic accuracy by focusing on physically meaningful features. Experimental validations demonstrate that training on signals from the calibrated DT model yields diagnostic accuracies exceeding 95\\% on real-world benchmarks, while uncalibrated models result in significantly lower performance, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios."

However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics."

However, most existing methods still rely on replaying data from previous stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which compromises privacy and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where data transfer across sites is often restricted. In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance. Extensive experiments across nine downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of InvCoSS, achieving performance comparable to or even superior to prior data-replay methods while significantly reducing storage requirements and eliminating data privacy constraints."

To exploit the potential of GS-based approaches, we present GaussianImage++, which utilizes limited Gaussian primitives to achieve impressive representation and compression performance. Firstly, we introduce a distortion-driven densification mechanism. It progressively allocates Gaussian primitives according to signal intensity. Secondly, we employ context-aware Gaussian filters for each primitive, which assist in the densification to optimize Gaussian primitives based on varying image content. Thirdly, we integrate attribute-separated learnable scalar quantizers and quantization-aware training, enabling efficient compression of primitive attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach."

        "abstract": "Achieving precise camera control in video generation remains challenging, as existing methods often rely on camera pose annotations that are difficult to scale to large and dynamic datasets and are frequently inconsistent with depth estimation, leading to train-test discrepancies. We introduce CETCAM, a camera-controllable video generation framework that eliminates the need for camera annotations through a consistent and extensible tokenization scheme. CETCAM leverages recent advances in geometry foundation models, such as VGGT, to estimate depth and camera parameters and converts them into unified, geometry-aware tokens. These tokens are seamlessly integrated into a pretrained video diffusion backbone via lightweight context blocks. Trained in two progressive stages, CETCAM first learns robust camera controllability from diverse raw video data and then refines fine-grained visual quality using curated high-fidelity datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art geometric consistency, temporal stability, and visual realism. Moreover, CETCAM exhibits strong adaptability to additional control modalities, including inpainting and layout control, highlighting its flexibility beyond camera control.

        "abstract": "Capsule endoscopy has enabled minimally invasive gastrointestinal imaging, but its clinical utility is limited by the inherently low resolution of captured images due to hardware, power, and transmission constraints. This limitation hampers the identification of fine-grained mucosal textures and subtle pathological features essential for early diagnosis.\n  This work investigates a diffusion-based super-resolution framework to enhance capsule endoscopy images in a data-driven and anatomically consistent manner. We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images. Unlike GAN-based approaches that often suffer from training instability and hallucination artifacts, diffusion models provide stable likelihood-based training and improved structural fidelity. The HyperKvasir dataset, a large-scale publicly available gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, is used for training and evaluation.\n  Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution methods such as ESRGAN, achieving PSNR of 27.5 dB and SSIM of 0.65 for a baseline model, and improving to 29.3 dB and 0.71 with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms. Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures. These findings indicate that diffusion-based super-resolution is a promising approach for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where image resolution is fundamentally constrained."

This limitation leads to ``Semantic-Visual Dissonance,'' where accurate facial geometry clashes with the input's unique atmosphere, causing an unnatural ``sticker-like'' effect. We propose **DVI (Disentangled Visual-Identity)**, a zero-shot framework that orthogonally disentangles identity into fine-grained semantic and coarse-grained visual streams. Unlike methods relying solely on semantic vectors, DVI exploits the inherent statistical properties of the VAE latent space, utilizing mean and variance as lightweight descriptors for global visual atmosphere. We introduce a **Parameter-Free Feature Modulation** mechanism that adaptively modulates semantic embeddings with these visual statistics, effectively injecting the reference's ``visual soul'' without training. Furthermore, a **Dynamic Temporal Granularity Scheduler** aligns with the diffusion process, prioritizing visual atmosphere in early denoising stages while refining semantic details later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVI significantly enhances visual consistency and atmospheric fidelity without parameter fine-tuning, maintaining robust identity preservation and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in IBench evaluations."

        "abstract": "Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task for autonomous driving and robotic scene understanding. It aims to infer a complete 3D volumetric representation of both semantics and geometry from a single image. Existing methods typically focus on end-to-end 2D-to-3D feature lifting and voxel completion. However, they often overlook the interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning caused by single-image input, which can lead to feature dilution and error propagation.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce an offline Visible Region Label Extraction (VRLE) strategy that explicitly separates and extracts voxel-level supervision for visible regions from dense 3D ground truth. This strategy purifies the supervisory space for two complementary sub-tasks: visible-region perception and occluded-region reasoning. Building on this idea, we propose the Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network (VOIC), a novel dual-decoder framework that explicitly decouples SSC into visible-region semantic perception and occluded-region scene completion. VOIC first constructs a base 3D voxel representation by fusing image features with depth-derived occupancy. The visible decoder focuses on generating high-fidelity geometric and semantic priors, while the occlusion decoder leverages these priors together with cross-modal interaction to perform coherent global scene reasoning.\n  Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that VOIC outperforms existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

This limitation stems from the intrinsic constraints of pixel-only training objectives, which inherently bias models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of learning underlying kinematic principles. To address this, we introduce EchoMotion, a framework designed to model the joint distribution of appearance and human motion, thereby improving the quality of complex human action video generation. EchoMotion extends the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) framework with a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes tokens concatenated from different modalities. Furthermore, we propose MVS-RoPE (Motion-Video Syncronized RoPE), which offers unified 3D positional encoding for both video and motion tokens. By providing a synchronized coordinate system for the dual-modal latent sequence, MVS-RoPE establishes an inductive bias that fosters temporal alignment between the two modalities. We also propose a Motion-Video Two-Stage Training Strategy. This strategy enables the model to perform both the joint generation of complex human action videos and their corresponding motion sequences, as well as versatile cross-modal conditional generation tasks. To facilitate the training of a model with these capabilities, we construct HuMoVe, a large-scale dataset of approximately 80,000 high-quality, human-centric video-motion pairs. Our findings reveal that explicitly representing human motion is complementary to appearance, significantly boosting the coherence and plausibility of human-centric video generation."

While neural surrogates promise a paradigm shift, the field currently suffers from an \"illusion of mastery\", as repeatedly emphasized in top-tier commentaries: existing evaluations overly rely on simplified, low-dimensional proxies, which fail to expose the models' inherent fragility in realistic regimes. To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures."

Existing approaches focus solely on updating a single scene without supporting novel-state synthesis. Others rely on diffusion-based object-background decoupling that works on one state at a time and cannot fuse information across multiple observations. To address these limitations, we introduce RecurGS, a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving representation capable of interaction. RecurGS detects object-level changes across consecutive states, aligns their geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, and performs recurrent updates that preserve historical structures through replay supervision. A voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module selectively incorporates newly observed regions while keeping stable areas fixed, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient long-horizon updates. RecurGS supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, and maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework delivers high-quality reconstructions with substantially improved update efficiency, providing a scalable step toward continuously interactive Gaussian worlds."

Given an image and a user-provided mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using an estimated depth map as a geometric prior, and then employs a dual-branch diffusion model. Leveraging a learned consistency from rotation-aligned and scale-aligned training data, this model further rectify residual distortions from the coarse result and translate it into a complete set of material maps, including albedo, normal, roughness and height. Our framework achieves invariance to the unknown illumination and perspective of the input image, allowing for the recovery of intrinsic material properties from casual captures.

To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE). Instead of training from scratch, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that augments a pre-trained RIFE backbone with semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer. We propose a Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress and refine high-dimensional features, and a Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align these semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields. Experiments on SNU-FILM demonstrate that semantic injection provides a decisive boost in perceptual fidelity. SG-RIFE outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS and achieves quality comparable to Consec. BB on complex benchmarks while running significantly faster, proving that semantic consistency enables flow-based methods to achieve diffusion-competitive perceptual quality in near real-time."

We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error. These results demonstrate that metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera."

The complete codebase is available at https://github.com/devang1304/provex.git.

We adapt three GNN explanation methods - GraphMask, GNNExplainer, and a variational temporal GNN explainer (VA-TGExplainer) - to the temporal provenance context. These tools output human-interpretable representations of anomalous behavior, including important edges and uncertainty estimates. Our contributions focus on the practical integration of these explainers, addressing challenges in memory management and reproducibility. We demonstrate our framework on the DARPA CADETS Engagement 3 dataset and show that it produces concise window-level explanations for detected attacks. Our evaluation reveals that the explainers preserve the TGNN's decisions with high fidelity, surfacing critical edges such as malicious file interactions and anomalous netflows.

We use a fully solvable one-dimensional Ising model to show that local basis rotations leave the loss landscape unchanged while relocating the exact wavefunction in parameter space, effectively increasing its geometric distance from typical initializations. By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities. We introduce a framework based on an analytically solvable rotated Ising model to investigate how relocating the target wavefunction within a fixed loss landscape exposes information-geometric barriers,such as saddle points and high-curvature regions,that hinder shallow NQS optimization, underscoring the need for landscape-aware model design in variational training."

Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes.

To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps. As a result, we achieve unprecedented face reconstruction quality that can run at scale on in-the-wild data."

The enormous size of chemical space and the cost of high-fidelity simulations have driven the development of machine learning-guided strategies for accelerating design with limited data. Among these, Bayesian optimization (BO) offers a principled framework for sample-efficient search, while generative models provide a mechanism to propose novel, diverse candidates beyond fixed libraries. However, existing methods that couple the two often rely on continuous latent spaces, which introduces both architectural entanglement and scalability challenges. This work introduces an alternative, modular \"generate-then-optimize\" framework for de novo multi-objective molecular design/discovery. At each iteration, a generative model is used to construct a large, diverse pool of candidate molecules, after which a novel acquisition function, qPMHI (multi-point Probability of Maximum Hypervolume Improvement), is used to optimally select a batch of candidates most likely to induce the largest Pareto front expansion. The key insight is that qPMHI decomposes additively, enabling exact, scalable batch selection via only simple ranking of probabilities that can be easily estimated with Monte Carlo sampling. We benchmark the framework against state-of-the-art latent-space and discrete molecular optimization methods, demonstrating significant improvements across synthetic benchmarks and application-driven tasks. Specifically, in a case study related to sustainable energy storage, we show that our approach quickly uncovers novel, diverse, and high-performing organic (quinone-based) cathode materials for aqueous redox flow battery applications."

Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance."

        "abstract": "We propose a generative framework for producing high-quality PBR textures on a given 3D mesh. As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17292v1",
        "abstract": "Many image restoration (IR) tasks require both pixel-level fidelity and high-level semantic understanding to recover realistic photos with fine-grained details. However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities."

However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation."

Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses.\n  This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.\n  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.\n  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains."

Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering."

        "abstract": "Recent progress in video diffusion models has spurred growing interest in camera-controlled novel-view video generation for dynamic scenes, aiming to provide creators with cinematic camera control capabilities in post-production. A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations.

Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models."

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement."

This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods.

        "abstract": "Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained."

Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline."

However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods."

Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions."

To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space.

        "abstract": "Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it visualizes and quantifies neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows."

Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation."

To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability."

Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.\n  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%.

Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers.

The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs."

We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation.

A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video.

In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks."

In this work, we propose RELIC-GNN, a graph neural network based state registers identification method, to address these issues. RELIC-GNN models the path structure of register as a graph and generates corresponding representation by considering node attributes and graph structure during training. The trained GNN model could be adopted to find the registers type very efficiently.

However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability.

The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets. Computational experiments on Syngas and GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanisms demonstrate that our framework achieves high fidelity in predicting complex kinetic behavior using only the initial conditions of the state variables."

Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines.

This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

        "abstract": "Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes."

Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines.

        "abstract": "We present a method for jointly recovering the appearance and internal structure of botanical plants from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance. Experiments show that the GaussianPlant achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling the extraction of branch structure and leaf instances."

A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fr\u00e9chet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fr\u00e9chet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fr\u00e9chet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fr\u00e9chet derivative learning. Numerical examples on nonlinear diffusion--reaction, Helmholtz, and Navier--Stokes equations demonstrate that DIFNOs are superior in sample complexity for operator learning and solving infinite-dimensional PDE-constrained inverse problems, achieving high accuracy at low training sample sizes."

To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution. First, we propose an LQ-guided feature modulation module that leverages original uncompressed information from LQ inputs to provide high-fidelity conditioning for the diffusion process. We then develop a region-adaptive generative prior activation method to effectively enhance perceptual richness without sacrificing local structural fidelity. Finally, we employ a text-matching guidance strategy to fully harness the conditioning potential of text prompts.

Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters."

These factors degrade image quality, while the scarcity and structural repetition of marine datasets limit the diversity of available training data. Although mask-conditioned diffusion models can synthesize layout-aligned samples, they often produce low-diversity outputs when conditioned on low-entropy masks and prompts, limiting their utility for improving robustness. In this paper, we propose a quality-driven and diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline that generates training data entirely at inference time, without retraining the diffusion model. The framework combines two key components:(i) a class-aware style bank that constructs high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts, and (ii) an adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning, while a COD-guided proportional controller regulates this perturbation to boost diversity without compromising layout fidelity. Across marine obstacle benchmarks, augmenting training data with these controlled synthetic samples consistently improves segmentation performance across multiple backbones and increases visual variation in rare and texture-sensitive classes."

First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity.

While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives."

        "abstract": "We propose a multimodal-driven framework for high-fidelity long-term digital human animation termed $\\textbf{Soul}$, which generates semantically coherent videos from a single-frame portrait image, text prompts, and audio, achieving precise lip synchronization, vivid facial expressions, and robust identity preservation. We construct Soul-1M, containing 1 million finely annotated samples with a precise automated annotation pipeline (covering portrait, upper-body, full-body, and multi-person scenes) to mitigate data scarcity, and we carefully curate Soul-Bench for comprehensive and fair evaluation of audio-/text-guided animation methods. The model is built on the Wan2.2-5B backbone, integrating audio-injection layers and multiple training strategies together with threshold-aware codebook replacement to ensure long-term generation consistency. Meanwhile, step/CFG distillation and a lightweight VAE are used to optimize inference efficiency, achieving an 11.4$\\times$ speedup with negligible quality loss. Extensive experiments show that Soul significantly outperforms current leading open-source and commercial models on video quality, video-text alignment, identity preservation, and lip-synchronization accuracy, demonstrating broad applicability in real-world scenarios such as virtual anchors and film production.

        "abstract": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have long been applied in the field of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

        "abstract": "Visual tokenizers play a crucial role in diffusion models. The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements. Code and model are available at https://shi-qingyu.github.io/rectok.github.io."

While accurate, these approaches are computationally expensive, limiting their use in real-time and large-scale clinical applications. We propose a proof-of-concept deep learning (DL) framework as an efficient surrogate for forward solvers. The model adopts a time-dependent, attention-based sequence-to-sequence architecture to predict electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from cardiac voltage propagation maps. A hybrid loss combining Huber loss with a spectral entropy term was introduced to preserve both temporal and frequency-domain fidelity. Using 2D tissue simulations incorporating healthy, fibrotic, and gap junction-remodelled conditions, the model achieved high accuracy (mean $R^2 = 0.99 \\pm 0.01$). Ablation studies confirmed the contributions of convolutional encoders, time-aware attention, and spectral entropy loss. These findings highlight DL as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to physics-based solvers, with potential for clinical and digital twin applications."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new perspectives for automation in optimization. While several studies have explored how LLMs can generate or solve optimization models, far less is understood about what these models actually learn regarding problem structure or algorithmic behavior. This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance."

In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios."

To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results.

While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models."

This limitation motivates the development of multi-fidelity strategies that leverage inexpensive low-fidelity information without compromising accuracy. Addressing this challenge, this work presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework that combines autoencoder-based transfer learning with a newly developed Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) strategy to achieve uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion under extreme data scarcity. The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data. Furthermore, the MSCP framework produces robust, actionable uncertainty bands with pointwise coverage exceeding 95%. By combining extreme data efficiency with uncertainty quantification, this work offers a scalable and reliable solution for aerodynamic regression in data-scarce environments."

        "abstract": "The Multimodal Direct Inversion (MMDI) algorithm is widely used in Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) to estimate tissue shear stiffness. However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."

Using \"cognitive parallelism,\" agents reason independently to maintain context purity while execution is serialized on resource-constrained hardware (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2060). The framework integrates external knowledge via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and prioritizes vulnerabilities using the Quantum-Adjusted Risk Score (QARS), a formal extension of Mosca's Theorem.

These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites."

Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning.

We develop a conditional neural operator architecture based on feature-wise linear modulation for flow matching vector fields directly in function space, enabling inference at arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining. To improve stability and representational control of the induced neural ODE, we parameterize the flow vector field as a sum of a linear operator and a nonlinear operator, combining lightweight linear components with a conditioned Fourier neural operator for expressive, input-dependent dynamics. We then formulate a residual-augmented learning strategy where the flow model learns probabilistic corrections from inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates to high-fidelity solutions, rather than learning the full solution mapping from scratch. Finally, we derive tractable training objectives that extend conditional flow matching to the operator setting with input-function-dependent couplings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical experiments on a range of PDEs, including the 1D advection and Burgers' equation, and a 2D Darcy flow problem for flow through a porous medium.

Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks.

Our experiments demonstrate that MobiBench achieves 94.72 percent agreement with human evaluators, on par with carefully engineered online benchmarks, while preserving the scalability and reproducibility of static offline benchmarks. Furthermore, our comprehensive module level analysis uncovers several key insights, including a systematic evaluation of diverse techniques used in mobile GUI agents, optimal module configurations across model scales, the inherent limitations of current LFMs, and actionable guidelines for designing more capable and cost efficient mobile agents."

        "abstract": "We study geometry-aware scene-consistent image generation: given a reference scene image and a text condition specifying an entity to be generated in the scene and its spatial relation to the scene, the goal is to synthesize an output image that preserves the same physical environment as the reference scene while correctly generating the entity according to the spatial relation described in the text. Existing methods struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence: they either replicate the scene with high fidelity but poor responsiveness to the prompt, or prioritize prompt compliance at the expense of scene consistency. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce two key contributions: (i) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline that generates diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a novel geometry-guided attention loss that leverages cross-view cues to regularize the model's spatial reasoning. Experiments on our scene-consistent benchmark show that our approach achieves better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines, according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies. Our method produces geometrically coherent images with diverse compositions that remain faithful to the textual instructions and the underlying scene structure."

        "author": "Karthikeya KV",
        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12595v1",
        "abstract": "This research introduces a transformative framework for integrating Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced transformer-based architectures to tackle challenges in high-resolution image synthesis and multimodal data interpretation. The proposed model incorporates a rectified flow mechanism that connects noise and data with linear paths, enabling efficient and high-quality generation. A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations. The architecture is optimized with a noise-aware learning algorithm, addressing discrepancies in noisy data distributions and improving generative performance under varying input conditions. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate a 25% increase in image resolution clarity and a 20% reduction in computational requirements compared to diffusion-based methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits robust scalability and adaptability, showcasing its potential in applications like autonomous systems, creative content generation, and advanced video analysis. This work underscores the role of vision-centric LLMs in redefining capabilities in computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12534v1",
        "abstract": "We present Animus3D, a text-driven 3D animation framework that generates motion field given a static 3D asset and text prompt. Previous methods mostly leverage the vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) objective to distill motion from pretrained text-to-video diffusion, leading to animations with minimal movement or noticeable jitter. To address this, our approach introduces a novel SDS alternative, Motion Score Distillation (MSD). Specifically, we introduce a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model that defines a static source distribution rather than pure noise as in SDS, while another inversion-based noise estimation technique ensures appearance preservation when guiding motion. To further improve motion fidelity, we incorporate explicit temporal and spatial regularization terms that mitigate geometric distortions across time and space. Additionally, we propose a motion refinement module to upscale the temporal resolution and enhance fine-grained details, overcoming the fixed-resolution constraints of the underlying video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity. Code will be released at https://qiisun.github.io/animus3d_page."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12501v1",
        "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented opportunities for creative expression, education, and research. Text-to-image systems such as DALL.E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney can now convert ideas into visuals within seconds, but they also present a dual-use dilemma, raising critical ethical concerns: amplifying societal biases, producing high-fidelity disinformation, and violating intellectual property. This paper introduces SafeGen, a framework that embeds ethical safeguards directly into the text-to-image generation pipeline, grounding its design in established principles for Trustworthy AI. SafeGen integrates two complementary components: BGE-M3, a fine-tuned text classifier that filters harmful or misleading prompts, and Hyper-SD, an optimized diffusion model that produces high fidelity, semantically aligned images. Built on a curated multilingual (English- Vietnamese) dataset and a fairness-aware training process, SafeGen demonstrates that creative freedom and ethical responsibility can be reconciled within a single workflow. Quantitative evaluations confirm its effectiveness, with Hyper-SD achieving IS = 3.52, FID = 22.08, and SSIM = 0.79, while BGE-M3 reaches an F1-Score of 0.81. An ablation study further validates the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for both modules. Case studies illustrate SafeGen's practical impact in blocking unsafe prompts, generating inclusive teaching materials, and reinforcing academic integrity."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12487v1",
        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently been extended from text-only LLMs to vision-language models (VLMs) to elicit long-chain multimodal reasoning. However, RLVR-trained VLMs still exhibit two persistent failure modes: inaccurate visual extraction (missing or hallucinating details) and logically inconsistent chains-of-thought, largely because verifiable signals supervise only the final answer. We propose PeRL-VL (Perception and Reasoning Learning for Vision-Language Models), a decoupled framework that separately improves visual perception and textual reasoning on top of RLVR. For perception, PeRL-VL introduces a VLM-based description reward that scores the model's self-generated image descriptions for faithfulness and sufficiency. For reasoning, PeRL-VL adds a text-only Reasoning SFT stage on logic-rich chain-of-thought data, enhancing coherence and logical consistency independently of vision. Across diverse multimodal benchmarks, PeRL-VL improves average Pass@1 accuracy from 63.3% (base Qwen2.5-VL-7B) to 68.8%, outperforming standard RLVR, text-only reasoning SFT, and naive multimodal distillation from GPT-4o."

        "abstract": "With the advent of machine learning and quantum computing, the 21st century has gone from a place of relative algorithmic security, to one of speculative unease and possibly, cyber catastrophe.\n  Modern algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are the bastion of current cryptographic security protocols that form the backbone of consumer protection ranging from Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) in the modern internet browser, to cryptographic financial instruments like Bitcoin.\n  And there's been very little work put into testing the strength of these ciphers. Practically the only study that I could find was on side-channel recognition, a joint paper from the University of Milan, Italy and King's College, London\\cite{battistello2025ecc}.\n  These algorithms are already considered bulletproof by many consumers, but exploits already exist for them, and with computing power and distributed, federated compute on the rise, it's only a matter of time before these current bastions fade away into obscurity, and it's on all of us to stand up when we notice something is amiss, lest we see such passages claim victims in that process.\n  In this paper, we seek to explore the use of modern language model architecture in cracking the association between a known public key, and its associated private key, by intuitively learning to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process, effectively solving the curve.\n  Additonally, we attempt to ascertain modern machine learning's ability to memorize public-private secp256r1 keypairs, and to then test their ability to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process.\n  It is my belief that proof-for would be equally valuable as proof-against in either of these categories.\n  Finally, we'll conclude with some number crunching on where we see this particular field heading in the future."

        "abstract": "Various weather modelling problems (e.g., weather forecasting, optimizing turbine placements, etc.) require ample access to high-resolution, highly accurate wind data. Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\\times$ less than classical methods."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12461v1",
        "abstract": "Local field potentials (LFPs) can be routinely recorded alongside spiking activity in intracortical neural experiments, measure a larger complementary spatiotemporal scale of brain activity for scientific inquiry, and can offer practical advantages over spikes, including greater long-term stability, robustness to electrode degradation, and lower power requirements. Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."
