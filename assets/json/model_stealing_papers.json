More precisely, we utilize the system-call\ndependency graphs (or, for short ScD graphs), obtained by capturing taint\nanalysis traces and a set of various similarity metrics in order to detect\nwhether an unknown test sample is a malicious or a benign one. For the sake of\ngeneralization, we decide to empower our model against strong mutations by\napplying our detection technique on a weighted directed graph resulting from\nScD graph after grouping disjoint subsets of its vertices. Additionally, we\nhave developed a similarity metric, which we call NP-similarity, that combines\nqualitative, quantitative, and relational characteristics that are spread among\nthe members of known malware families to archives a clear distinction between\ngraph-representations of malware and the ones of benign software. Finally, we\nevaluate our detection model and compare our results against the results\nachieved by a variety of techniques proving the potentials of our model."

        "abstract": "Rules, regulations, and policies are the basis of civilized society and are\nused to coordinate the activities of individuals who have a variety of goals\nand purposes. History has taught that over-regulation (too many rules) makes it\ndifficult to compete and under-regulation (too few rules) can lead to crisis.\nThis implies an optimal number of rules that avoids these two extremes. Rules\ncreate boundaries that define the latitude an individual has to perform their\nactivities. This paper creates a Toy Model of a work environment and examines\nit with respect to the latitude provided to a normal individual and the\nlatitude provided to an insider threat. Simulations with the Toy Model\nillustrate four regimes with respect to an insider threat: under-regulated,\npossibly optimal, tipping-point, and over-regulated. These regimes depend up\nthe number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal\nindividual to carry out their activities. The Toy Model is then mapped onto the\nstandard 1D Percolation Model from theoretical physics and the same behavior is\nobserved. This allows the Toy Model to be generalized to a wide array of more\ncomplex models that have been well studied by the theoretical physics community\nand also show the same behavior. Finally, by estimating N and Lmin it should be\npossible to determine the regime of any particular environment."

        "abstract": "Many efficient data structures use randomness, allowing them to improve upon\ndeterministic ones. Usually, their efficiency and correctness are analyzed\nusing probabilistic tools under the assumption that the inputs and queries are\nindependent of the internal randomness of the data structure. In this work, we\nconsider data structures in a more robust model, which we call the adversarial\nmodel. Roughly speaking, this model allows an adversary to choose inputs and\nqueries adaptively according to previous responses. Specifically, we consider a\ndata structure known as \"Bloom filter\" and prove a tight connection between\nBloom filters in this model and cryptography.\n  A Bloom filter represents a set $S$ of elements approximately, by using fewer\nbits than a precise representation. The price for succinctness is allowing some\nerrors: for any $x \\in S$ it should always answer `Yes', and for any $x \\notin\nS$ it should answer `Yes' only with small probability.\n  In the adversarial model, we consider both efficient adversaries (that run in\npolynomial time) and computationally unbounded adversaries that are only\nbounded in the number of queries they can make. For computationally bounded\nadversaries, we show that non-trivial (memory-wise) Bloom filters exist if and\nonly if one-way functions exist. For unbounded adversaries we show that there\nexists a Bloom filter for sets of size $n$ and error $\\varepsilon$, that is\nsecure against $t$ queries and uses only $O(n \\log{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}+t)$\nbits of memory. In comparison, $n\\log{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}$ is the best\npossible under a non-adaptive adversary."

To\nmaintain the mean photon number in two-way systems, such as plug-and-play and\nrelativistic quantum cryptography schemes, bright pulse energy incoming from\nthe communication channel must be monitored.

Our model\nprovides a clean component abstraction, thereby in particular ruling out\nundesired component accesses and ensuring that no undesired information flow\ntakes place between application components -- either trusted from the base\napplication or untrusted from various extensions. We then instantiate our model\nin the SAFE web application framework (WWW 2012), resulting in a novel\nmethodology that is inspired by traditional access control and specifically\ndesigned for the newly emerging needs of extensibility in application\necosystems.

One way to resolve the conflict is to extract\ngeneral characteristics of whole populations without disclosing the private\ninformation of individuals.\n  In this paper, we consider differential privacy, one of the most popular and\npowerful definitions of privacy. We explore the interplay between machine\nlearning and differential privacy, namely privacy-preserving machine learning\nalgorithms and learning-based data release mechanisms. We also describe some\ntheoretical results that address what can be learned differentially privately\nand upper bounds of loss functions for differentially private algorithms.\n  Finally, we present some open questions, including how to incorporate public\ndata, how to deal with missing data in private datasets, and whether, as the\nnumber of observed samples grows arbitrarily large, differentially private\nmachine learning algorithms can be achieved at no cost to utility as compared\nto corresponding non-differentially private algorithms."

To achieve the privacy\nrequirements, we use homomorphic encryption in the following protocol: the data\nowner encrypts the data and sends the ciphertexts to the third party to obtain\na prediction from a trained model. The model operates on these ciphertexts and\nsends back the encrypted prediction. In this protocol, not only the data\nremains private, even the values predicted are available only to the data\nowner.\n  Using homomorphic encryption and modifications to the activation functions\nand training algorithms of neural networks, we show that it is protocol is\npossible and may be feasible.

Major outages such as the China Telecom incident in\n2010 stimulate speculations about malicious intentions behind such anomalies.\nSurprisingly, almost all discussions in the current literature assume that\nhijacking incidents are enabled by the lack of security mechanisms in the\ninter-domain routing protocol BGP. In this paper, we discuss an attacker model\nthat accounts for the hijacking of network ownership information stored in\nRegional Internet Registry (RIR) databases. We show that such threats emerge\nfrom abandoned Internet resources (e.g., IP address blocks, AS numbers). When\nDNS names expire, attackers gain the opportunity to take resource ownership by\nre-registering domain names that are referenced by corresponding RIR database\nobjects. We argue that this kind of attack is more attractive than conventional\nhijacking, since the attacker can act in full anonymity on behalf of a victim.\nDespite corresponding incidents have been observed in the past, current\ndetection techniques are not qualified to deal with these attacks. We show that\nthey are feasible with very little effort, and analyze the risk potential of\nabandoned Internet resources for the European service region: our findings\nreveal that currently 73 /24 IP prefixes and 7 ASes are vulnerable to be\nstealthily abused.

        "abstract": "Many techniques for privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) have been\ninvestigated over the past decade. Often, the entities involved in the data\nmining process are end-users or organizations with limited computing and\nstorage resources. As a result, such entities may want to refrain from\nparticipating in the PPDM process. To overcome this issue and to take many\nother benefits of cloud computing, outsourcing PPDM tasks to the cloud\nenvironment has recently gained special attention. We consider the scenario\nwhere n entities outsource their databases (in encrypted format) to the cloud\nand ask the cloud to perform the clustering task on their combined data in a\nprivacy-preserving manner. We term such a process as privacy-preserving and\noutsourced distributed clustering (PPODC). In this paper, we propose a novel\nand efficient solution to the PPODC problem based on k-means clustering\nalgorithm. The main novelty of our solution lies in avoiding the secure\ndivision operations required in computing cluster centers altogether through an\nefficient transformation technique. Our solution builds the clusters securely\nin an iterative fashion and returns the final cluster centers to all entities\nwhen a pre-determined termination condition holds. The proposed solution\nprotects data confidentiality of all the participating entities under the\nstandard semi-honest model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first\nwork to discuss and propose a comprehensive solution to the PPODC problem that\nincurs negligible cost on the participating entities.

Modern\nsystems often exist in an environment of heterogeneous trust, in which\ndifferent participants may have different opinions about the trustworthiness of\nother nodes, and a single participant may consider other nodes to differ in\ntheir trustworthiness. We explore how to construct distributed protocols that\nmeet the requirements of all participants, even in heterogeneous trust\nenvironments. The key to our approach is using lattice-based information flow\nto analyse and prove protocol properties. To demonstrate this approach, we show\nhow two earlier distributed algorithms can be generalized to work in the\npresence of heterogeneous trust: first, Heterogeneous Fast Consensus, an\nadaptation of the earlier Bosco Fast Consensus protocol; and second, Nysiad, an\nalgorithm for converting crash-tolerant protocols to be Byzantine-tolerant.\nThrough simulations, we show that customizing a protocol to a heterogeneous\ntrust configuration yields performance improvements over the conventional\nprotocol designed for homogeneous trust."

For example, operators can opportunistically leverage\nthe delay tolerance of energy demands in order to balance the energy load over\ntime, and hence, reduce the total operational cost. This opportunity, however,\ncomes with security threats, as the grid becomes more vulnerable to\ncyber-attacks. In this paper, we study the impact of such malicious\ncyber-attacks on the energy efficiency of the grid in a simplified setup. More\nprecisely, we consider a simple model where the energy demands of the smart\ngrid consumers are intercepted and altered by an active attacker before they\narrive at the operator, who is equipped with limited intrusion detection\ncapabilities. We formulate the resulting optimization problems faced by the\noperator and the attacker and propose several scheduling and attack strategies\nfor both parties. Interestingly, our results show that, as opposed to\nfacilitating cost reduction in the smart grid, increasing the delay tolerance\nof the energy demands potentially allows the attacker to force increased costs\non the system. This highlights the need for carefully constructed and robust\nintrusion detection mechanisms at the operator."

Furthermore, we show that faults on the code\n(skipping instructions) can be captured by considering only faults on the data.\nThese intermediate results allow us to improve the state of the art in several\nways: (a) we fix an existing and that was known to be broken countermeasure\n(namely the one from Shamir); (b) we drastically optimize an existing\ncountermeasure (namely the one from Vigilant) which we reduce to 3 tests\ninstead of 9 in its original version, and prove that it resists not only one\nfault but also an arbitrary number of randomizing faults; (c) we also show how\nto upgrade countermeasures to resist any given number of faults: given a\ncorrect first-order countermeasure, we present a way to design a prov-able\nhigh-order countermeasure (for a well-defined and reasonable fault model).\nFinally, we pave the way for a generic approach against fault attacks for any\nmodular arithmetic computations, and thus for the automatic insertion of\ncountermeasures."

It employs new HTML5 features (such\nas web messaging and web storage) and cryptographic assertions to provide\ndecentralized login, with the intent to respect users' privacy. It can operate\nin a primary and a secondary identity provider mode. While in the primary mode\nBrowserID runs with arbitrary identity providers (IdPs), in the secondary mode\nthere is one IdP only, namely Mozilla's default IdP.\n  We recently proposed an expressive general model for the web infrastructure\nand, based on this web model, analyzed the security of the secondary IdP mode\nof BrowserID. The analysis revealed several severe vulnerabilities.\n  In this paper, we complement our prior work by analyzing the even more\ncomplex primary IdP mode of BrowserID. We do not only study authentication\nproperties as before, but also privacy properties. During our analysis we\ndiscovered new and practical attacks that do not apply to the secondary mode:\nan identity injection attack, which violates a central authentication property\nof SSO systems, and attacks that break an important privacy promise of\nBrowserID and which do not seem to be fixable without a major redesign of the\nsystem. Some of our attacks on privacy make use of a browser side channel that\nhas not gained a lot of attention so far.\n  For the authentication bug, we propose a fix and formally prove in a slight\nextension of our general web model that the fixed system satisfies all the\nrequirements we consider. This constitutes the most complex formal analysis of\na web application based on an expressive model of the web infrastructure so\nfar.\n  As another contribution, we identify and prove important security properties\nof generic web features in the extended web model to facilitate future analysis\nefforts of web standards and web applications."

The SDA framework\n(designed to be resilient to both insider and outsider attacks) comprises of a\npair-wise key establishment mechanism run along the edges of a data gathering\ntree and a distributed trust evaluation model that is tightly integrated with\nthe data aggregation process itself. If an aggregator node already shares a\nsecret key with its child node, the two nodes locally coordinate to refresh and\nestablish a new pair-wise secret key; otherwise, the aggregator node requests\nthe sink to send a seed-secret key message that is used as the basis to\nestablish a new pair-wise secret key. The trust evaluation model uses the\ntwo-sided Grubbs test to identify outlier data in the periodic beacons\ncollected from the child nodes (neighbor) nodes. Once the estimated trust score\nfor a neighbor node falls below a threshold, the sensor node locally classifies\nits neighbor node as a Compromised or Faulty (CF) node, and discards the data\nor aggregated data received from the CF node. This way, the erroneous data\ngenerated by the CF nodes could be filtered at various levels of the data\ngathering tree and are prevented from reaching the root node (sink node).\nFinally, we assess the effectiveness of our trust evaluation model through a\ncomprehensive simulation study."

        "abstract": "Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a standard technique in machine\nlearning, where a model is selected by minimizing a loss function over\nconstraint set. When the training dataset consists of private information, it\nis natural to use a differentially private ERM algorithm, and this problem has\nbeen the subject of a long line of work started with Chaudhuri and Monteleoni\n2008. A private ERM algorithm outputs an approximate minimizer of the loss\nfunction and its error can be measured as the difference from the optimal value\nof the loss function. When the constraint set is arbitrary, the required error\nbounds are fairly well understood \\cite{BassilyST14}. In this work, we show\nthat the geometric properties of the constraint set can be used to derive\nsignificantly better results. Specifically, we show that a differentially\nprivate version of Mirror Descent leads to error bounds of the form\n$\\tilde{O}(G_{\\mathcal{C}}/n)$ for a lipschitz loss function, improving on the\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{p}/n)$ bounds in Bassily, Smith and Thakurta 2014. Here $p$ is\nthe dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number of data points in the\ntraining set, and $G_{\\mathcal{C}}$ denotes the Gaussian width of the\nconstraint set that we optimize over. We show similar improvements for strongly\nconvex functions, and for smooth functions. In addition, we show that when the\nloss function is Lipschitz with respect to the $\\ell_1$ norm and $\\mathcal{C}$\nis $\\ell_1$-bounded, a differentially private version of the Frank-Wolfe\nalgorithm gives error bounds of the form $\\tilde{O}(n^{-2/3})$. This captures\nthe important and common case of sparse linear regression (LASSO), when the\ndata $x_i$ satisfies $|x_i|_{\\infty} \\leq 1$ and we optimize over the $\\ell_1$\nball. We show new lower bounds for this setting, that together with known\nbounds, imply that all our upper bounds are tight."

A prominent family of DB protocols are those\nbased on graphs, which were introduced in 2010 to resist both mafia and\ndistance frauds. The security analysis in terms of distance fraud is performed\nby considering an adversary that, given a vertex labeled graph $G = (V, E)$ and\na vertex $v \\in V$, is able to find the most frequent $n$-long sequence in $G$\nstarting from $v$ (MFS problem). However, to the best of our knowledge, it is\nstill an open question whether the distance fraud security can be computed\nconsidering the aforementioned adversarial model. Our first contribution is a\nproof that the MFS problem is NP-Hard even when the graph is constrained to\nmeet the requirements of a graph-based DB protocol. Although this result does\nnot invalidate the model, it does suggest that a \\emph{too-strong} adversary is\nperhaps being considered (i.e., in practice, graph-based DB protocols might\nresist distance fraud better than the security model suggests.)

While researchers have advocated using virtualization to detect\nand prevent attacks on operating systems (e.g., VM introspection and trusted\nvirtual domains), virtualization is not practical on smartphone systems due to\nthe lack of virtualization support and/or the expense of virtualization.\nCurrent smartphone processors do have hardware support for running a protected\nenvironment, such as the ARM TrustZone extensions, but such hardware does not\ncontrol the operating system operations sufficiently to enable VM\nintrospection. In particular, a conventional operating system running with\nTrustZone still retains full control of memory management, which a rootkit can\nuse to prevent traps on sensitive instructions or memory accesses necessary for\neffective introspection. In this paper, we present SPROBES, a novel primitive\nthat enables introspection of operating systems running on ARM TrustZone\nhardware. Using SPROBES, an introspection mechanism protected by TrustZone can\ninstrument individual operating system instructions of its choice, receiving an\nunforgeable trap whenever any SPROBE is executed. The key challenge in\ndesigning SPROBES is preventing the rootkit from removing them, but we identify\na set of five invariants whose enforcement is sufficient to restrict rootkits\nto execute only approved, SPROBE-injected kernel code. We implemented a\nproof-of-concept version of SPROBES for the ARM Fast Models emulator,\ndemonstrating that in Linux kernel 2.6.38, only 12 SPROBES are sufficient to\nenforce all five of these invariants.

        "abstract": "One of the ways in which attackers try to steal sensitive information from\ncorporations is by sending spearphishing emails. This type of emails typically\nappear to be sent by one of the victim's coworkers, but have instead been\ncrafted by an attacker. A particularly insidious type of spearphishing emails\nare the ones that do not only claim to come from a trusted party, but were\nactually sent from that party's legitimate email account that was compromised\nin the first place. In this paper, we propose a radical change of focus in the\ntechniques used for detecting such malicious emails: instead of looking for\nparticular features that are indicative of attack emails, we look for possible\nindicators of impersonation of the legitimate owners. We present\nIdentityMailer, a system that validates the authorship of emails by learning\nthe typical email-sending behavior of users over time, and comparing any\nsubsequent email sent from their accounts against this model. Our experiments\non real world e-mail datasets demonstrate that our system can effectively block\nadvanced email attacks sent from genuine email accounts, which traditional\nprotection systems are unable to detect. Moreover, we show that it is resilient\nto an attacker willing to evade the system. To the best of our knowledge,\nIdentityMailer is the first system able to identify spearphishing emails that\nare sent from within an organization, by a skilled attacker having access to a\ncompromised email account."

        "abstract": "Concerns on location privacy frequently arise with the rapid development of\nGPS enabled devices and location-based applications. While spatial\ntransformation techniques such as location perturbation or generalization have\nbeen studied extensively, most techniques rely on syntactic privacy models\nwithout rigorous privacy guarantee. Many of them only consider static scenarios\nor perturb the location at single timestamps without considering temporal\ncorrelations of a moving user's locations, and hence are vulnerable to various\ninference attacks. While differential privacy has been accepted as a standard\nfor privacy protection, applying differential privacy in location based\napplications presents new challenges, as the protection needs to be enforced on\nthe fly for a single user and needs to incorporate temporal correlations\nbetween a user's locations.\n  In this paper, we propose a systematic solution to preserve location privacy\nwith rigorous privacy guarantee. First, we propose a new definition,\n\"$\\delta$-location set\" based differential privacy, to account for the temporal\ncorrelations in location data. Second, we show that the well known\n$\\ell_1$-norm sensitivity fails to capture the geometric sensitivity in\nmultidimensional space and propose a new notion, sensitivity hull, based on\nwhich the error of differential privacy is bounded. Third, to obtain the\noptimal utility we present a planar isotropic mechanism (PIM) for location\nperturbation, which is the first mechanism achieving the lower bound of\ndifferential privacy. Experiments on real-world datasets also demonstrate that\nPIM significantly outperforms baseline approaches in data utility."

Black-box vulnerability scanners are widely used in\nthe industry to reproduce (XSS) attacks automatically. In spite of the\ntechnical sophistication and advancement, previous work showed that black-box\nscanners miss a non-negligible portion of vulnerabilities, and report\nnon-existing, non-exploitable or uninteresting vulnerabilities. Unfortunately,\nthese results hold true even for XSS vulnerabilities, which are relatively\nsimple to trigger if compared, for instance, to logic flaws.\n  Black-box scanners have not been studied in depth on this vertical: knowing\nprecisely how scanners try to detect XSS can provide useful insights to\nunderstand their limitations, to design better detection methods. In this\npaper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed and systematic study on\n6 black-box web scanners (both proprietary and open source) that we conducted\nin coordination with the respective vendors. To this end, we developed an\nautomated tool to (1) extract the payloads used by each scanner, (2) distill\nthe \"templates\" that have originated each payload, (3) evaluate them according\nto quality indicators, and (4) perform a cross-scanner analysis. Unlike\nprevious work, our testbed application, which contains a large set of XSS\nvulnerabilities, including DOM XSS, was gradually retrofitted to accomodate for\nthe payloads that triggered no vulnerabilities.\n  Our analysis reveals a highly fragmented scenario. Scanners exhibit a wide\nvariety of distinct payloads, a non-uniform approach to fuzzing and mutating\nthe payloads, and a very diverse detection effectiveness."

        "abstract": "This paper revisits formalizations of information-theoretic security for\nsymmetric-key encryption and key agreement protocols which are very fundamental\nprimitives in cryptography. In general, we can formalize information-theoretic\nsecurity in various ways: some of them can be formalized as stand-alone\nsecurity by extending (or relaxing) Shannon's perfect secrecy or by other ways\nsuch as semantic security; some of them can be done based on composable\nsecurity. Then, a natural question about this is: what is the gap between the\nformalizations? To answer the question, we investigate relationships between\nseveral formalizations of information-theoretic security for symmetric-key\nencryption and key agreement protocols. Specifically, for symmetric-key\nencryption protocols in a general setting including the case where there exist\ndecryption-errors, we deal with the following formalizations of security:\nformalizations extended (or relaxed) from Shannon's perfect secrecy by using\nmutual information and statistical distance; information-theoretic analogues of\nindistinguishability and semantic security by Goldwasser and Micali; and\ncomposable security by Maurer et al. and Canetti. Then, we explicitly show the\nequivalence and non-equivalence between those formalizations. Under the model,\nwe also derive lower bounds on the adversary's (or distinguisher's) advantage\nand the size of secret-keys required under all of the above formalizations.\nAlthough some of them may be already known, we can explicitly derive them all\nat once through our relationships between the formalizations. In addition, we\nbriefly observe impossibility results which easily follow from the lower\nbounds. The similar results are also shown for key agreement protocols in a\ngeneral setting including the case where there exist agreement-errors in the\nprotocols."

The THRIVE system is designed for the malicious model\nwhere the cheating party may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol\nspecification. Since threshold homomorphic encryption scheme is used, a\nmalicious database owner cannot perform decryption on encrypted templates of\nthe users in the database. Therefore, security of the THRIVE system is enhanced\nusing a two-factor authentication scheme involving the user's private key and\nthe biometric data.

The\nproposed system is suitable for applications where the user does not want to\nreveal her biometrics to the verifier in plain form but she needs to proof her\nphysical presence by using biometrics. The system can be used with any\nbiometric modality and biometric feature extraction scheme whose output\ntemplates can be binarized.

In particular,\nindividuals have no choice but to blindly trust that these entities will\nrespect their privacy and protect their personal data. In this position paper,\nwe address this issue by proposing an utopian crypto-democracy model based on\nexisting scientific achievements from the field of cryptography. More\nprecisely, our main objective is to show that cryptographic primitives,\nincluding in particular secure multiparty computation, offer a practical\nsolution to protect privacy while minimizing the trust assumptions. In the\ncrypto-democracy envisioned, individuals do not have to trust a single physical\nentity with their personal data but rather their data is distributed among\nseveral institutions. Together these institutions form a virtual entity called\nthe Trustworthy that is responsible for the storage of this data but which can\nalso compute on it (provided first that all the institutions agree on this).\nFinally, we also propose a realistic proof-of-concept of the Trustworthy, in\nwhich the roles of institutions are played by universities. This\nproof-of-concept would have an important impact in demonstrating the\npossibilities offered by the crypto-democracy paradigm."

        "abstract": "Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and a few other efficient quantum\nalgorithms break many classical crypto-systems. In response, people proposed\npost-quantum cryptography based on computational problems that are believed\nhard even for quantum computers. However, security of these schemes against\n\\emph{quantum} attacks is elusive. This is because existing security analysis\n(almost) only deals with classical attackers and arguing security in the\npresence of quantum adversaries is challenging due to unique quantum features\nsuch as no-cloning.\n  This work proposes a general framework to study which classical security\nproofs can be restored in the quantum setting. Basically, we split a security\nproof into (a sequence of) classical security reductions, and investigate what\nsecurity reductions are \"quantum-friendly\". We characterize sufficient\nconditions such that a classical reduction can be \"lifted\" to the quantum\nsetting. We then apply our lifting theorems to post-quantum signature schemes.\nWe are able to show that the classical generic construction of hash-tree based\nsignatures from one-way functions and and a more efficient variant proposed\nin~\\cite{BDH11} carry over to the quantum setting. Namely, assuming existence\nof (classical) one-way functions that are resistant to efficient quantum\ninversion algorithms, there exists a quantum-secure signature scheme. We note\nthat the scheme in~\\cite{BDH11} is a promising (post-quantum) candidate to be\nimplemented in practice and our result further justifies it. Finally we\ndemonstrate the generality of our framework by showing that several existing\nworks (Full-Domain hash in the quantum random-oracle model~\\cite{Zha12ibe} and\nthe simple hybrid arguments framework in~\\cite{HSS11}) can be reformulated\nunder our unified framework."

It is demonstrated that the attacker learns to invest heavily in\nexploit creation for the platform with the least similarity to other platforms\nwhen faced with a diversity defense, while avoiding investment in exploits for\nthis least similar platform when facing a randomization defense. Additionally,\nit is demonstrated that the diversity-maximizing defense is superior for\nshorter duration attacker-defender engagements, but performs sub-optimally in\nextended attacker-defender interactions."

But for the last type, i.e., an app's non-sensitive and\nnon-shared data, there is a big problem in Android's current storage model\nwhich essentially encourages an app to save its non-sensitive data to shared\npublic storage that can be accessed by other apps. At first glance, it seems no\nproblem to do so, as those data are non-sensitive after all, but it implicitly\nassumes that app developers could correctly identify all sensitive data and\nprevent all possible information leakage from private-but-non-sensitive data.\nIn this paper, we will demonstrate that this is an invalid assumption with a\nthorough survey on information leaks of those apps that had followed Android's\nrecommended storage model for non-sensitive data. Our studies showed that\nhighly sensitive information from billions of users can be easily hacked by\nexploiting the mentioned problematic storage model. Although our empirical\nstudies are based on a limited set of apps, the identified problems are never\nisolated or accidental bugs of those apps being investigated. On the contrary,\nthe problem is rooted from the vulnerable storage model recommended by Android.\nTo mitigate the threat, we also propose a defense framework."

These approaches get data from sensors directly and\nneed corresponding sensor invoking permissions.\n  This paper presents a novel approach (GVS-Attack) to launch permission\nbypassing attacks from a zero permission Android application (VoicEmployer)\nthrough the speaker. The idea of GVS-Attack utilizes an Android system built-in\nvoice assistant module -- Google Voice Search. Through Android Intent\nmechanism, VoicEmployer triggers Google Voice Search to the foreground, and\nthen plays prepared audio files (like \"call number 1234 5678\") in the\nbackground. Google Voice Search can recognize this voice command and execute\ncorresponding operations. With ingenious designs, our GVS-Attack can forge\nSMS/Email, access privacy information, transmit sensitive data and achieve\nremote control without any permission.\n  Also we found a vulnerability of status checking in Google Search app, which\ncan be utilized by GVS-Attack to dial arbitrary numbers even when the phone is\nsecurely locked with password. A prototype of VoicEmployer has been implemented\nto demonstrate the feasibility of GVS-Attack in real world. In theory, nearly\nall Android devices equipped with Google Services Framework can be affected by\nGVS-Attack.

In 2008, Kasiviswanathan et al. (FOCS 2008) gave a generic\nconstruction of private learners, in which the sample complexity is (generally)\nhigher than what is needed for non-private learners. This gap in the sample\ncomplexity was then further studied in several followup papers, showing that\n(at least in some cases) this gap is unavoidable. Moreover, those papers\nconsidered ways to overcome the gap, by relaxing either the privacy or the\nlearning guarantees of the learner.\n  We suggest an alternative approach, inspired by the (non-private) models of\nsemi-supervised learning and active-learning, where the focus is on the sample\ncomplexity of labeled examples whereas unlabeled examples are of a\nsignificantly lower cost. We consider private semi-supervised learners that\noperate on a random sample, where only a (hopefully small) portion of this\nsample is labeled. The learners have no control over which of the sample\nelements are labeled. Our main result is that the labeled sample complexity of\nprivate learners is characterized by the VC dimension.\n  We present two generic constructions of private semi-supervised learners. The\nfirst construction is of learners where the labeled sample complexity is\nproportional to the VC dimension of the concept class, however, the unlabeled\nsample complexity of the algorithm is as big as the representation length of\ndomain elements. Our second construction presents a new technique for\ndecreasing the labeled sample complexity of a given private learner, while\nroughly maintaining its unlabeled sample complexity. In addition, we show that\nin some settings the labeled sample complexity does not depend on the privacy\nparameters of the learner."

As end users are becoming more\nand more concerned on the protection of their private information, it is even\nharder to track a specific user using conventional technologies. For example,\ncookies might be cleared by users regularly. Apple has stopped apps accessing\nUDIDs, and Android phones use some special permission to protect IMEI code. To\naddress this challenge, some recent studies have worked on tracing smart phones\nusing the hardware features resulted from the imperfect manufacturing process.\nThese works have demonstrated that different devices can be differentiated to\neach other. However, it still has a long way to go in order to replace cookie\nand be deployed in real world scenarios, especially in terms of properties like\nuniqueness, robustness, etc. In this paper, we presented a novel method to\ngenerate stable and unique device ID stealthy for smartphones by exploiting the\nfrequency response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies\nand special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impacts of non-linear\neffects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process un-noticeable to\nusers. The extracted feature is not only very stable for a given smart phone\nspeaker, but also unique to that phone. The feature contains rich information\nthat is equivalent to around 40 bits of entropy, which is enough to identify\nbillions of different smart phones of the same model. We have built a prototype\nto evaluate our method, and the results show that the generated device ID can\nbe used as a replacement of cookie."

Attack\ntechniques proposed in the literature often require detailed knowledge of\nsystem parameters. Such information is difficult to acquire in practice. The\nsubspace methods presented in this paper, on the other hand, learn the system\noperating subspace from measurements and launch attacks accordingly. Conditions\nfor the existence of an unobservable subspace attack are obtained under the\nfull and partial measurement models. Using the estimated system subspace, two\nattack strategies are presented. The first strategy aims to affect the system\nstate directly by hiding the attack vector in the system subspace. The second\nstrategy misleads the bad data detection mechanism so that data not under\nattack are removed. Performance of these attacks are evaluated using the IEEE\n14-bus network and the IEEE 118-bus network."

Our approach is based on the knowledge of the network\ntopology, which we model as a graph, and on the consequent possibility of\ncreating an interference to an ongoing attack of a Dolev-Yao attacker, by means\nof non-collaboration actuated by ad-hoc benign attackers that play the role of\nnetwork guardians.

We study not only\nhow but also where we can attempt to defend flawed security protocols: we\ninvestigate the different network topologies that make security protocol\ndefense feasible and illustrate our approach by means of concrete examples."

One major factor influencing mistakes and\nfailures is complexity of such tasks, which has been studied extensively in\nprior research. Another important issue which hardly received any attention is\nthe impact of both accidental and intended distractions on users performing\nsecurity-critical tasks. In particular, it is unclear whether, and to what\nextent, unexpected sensory cues (e.g., auditory or visual) can influence user\nbehavior and/or trigger mistakes. Better understanding of the effects of\nintended distractions will help clarify their role in adversarial models. As\npart of the research effort described in this paper, we administered a range of\nnaturally occurring -- yet unexpected -- sounds while study participants\nattempted to perform a security-critical task.

This paper proposes\na model of technical security metric to measure the effectiveness of network\nsecurity management. The measurement is based on the effectiveness of security\nperformance for (1) network security controls such as firewall, Intrusion\nDetection Prevention System (IDPS), switch, wireless access point, wireless\ncontrollers and network architecture; and (2) network services such as\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and virtual private network (VPN).\nWe use the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm [1] which links the measurement\ngoals to measurement questions and produce the metrics that can easily be\ninterpreted in compliance with the requirements.

More precisely, we present a simple\ntransformation which maps a protocol that is secure for a bounded number of\nprotocol sessions (a decidable problem) to a protocol that is secure for an\nunbounded number of sessions. The precise number of sessions that need to be\nconsidered is a function of the security property and we show that for several\nclassical security properties a single session is sufficient.

Since its\nintroduction in 2008, Bitcoin has gained noticeable popularity, mostly due to\nits following properties: (1) the transaction fees are very low, and (2) it is\nnot controlled by any central authority, which in particular means that nobody\ncan \"print\" the money to generate inflation. Moreover, the transaction syntax\nallows to create the so-called contracts, where a number of\nmutually-distrusting parties engage in a protocol to jointly perform some\nfinancial task, and the fairness of this process is guaranteed by the\nproperties of Bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin contracts have several potential\napplications in the digital economy, so far they have not been widely used in\nreal life. This is partly due to the fact that they are cumbersome to create\nand analyze, and hence risky to use.\n  In this paper we propose to remedy this problem by using the methods\noriginally developed for the computer-aided analysis for hardware and software\nsystems, in particular those based on the timed automata. More concretely, we\npropose a framework for modeling the Bitcoin contracts using the timed automata\nin the UPPAAL model checker. Our method is general and can be used to model\nseveral contracts. As a proof-of-concept we use this framework to model some of\nthe Bitcoin contracts from our recent previous work. We then automatically\nverify their security in UPPAAL, finding (and correcting) some subtle errors\nthat were difficult to spot by the manual analysis.

Thus, we propose Dovetail, a next-generation\nInternet routing protocol that provides anonymity against an active attacker\nlocated at any single point within the network, including the user's ISP. A\nmajor design challenge is to provide this protection without including an\napplication-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this challenge in path\nconstruction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path\nsegments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then trims away part of\nthe path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. Additional design\nfeatures include the choice of many different paths through the network and the\njoining of path segments without requiring a trusted third party. We develop a\nsystematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our designs, and\nwe demonstrate the privacy and efficiency of our proposal by simulation, using\na model of the complete Internet at the AS-level."

        "abstract": "The sum secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of two fundamental multi-user\nnetwork structures, the K-user Gaussian multiple access (MAC) wiretap channel\nand the K-user interference channel (IC) with secrecy constraints, have been\ndetermined recently as K(K-1)/(K(K-1)+1) [1,2] and K(K-1)/(2K-1) [3,4],\nrespectively. In this paper, we determine the entire s.d.o.f. regions of these\ntwo channel models. The converse for the MAC follows from a middle step in the\nconverse of [1,2]. The converse for the IC includes constraints both due to\nsecrecy as well as due to interference. Although the portion of the region\nclose to the optimum sum s.d.o.f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to\nsecrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper\nbounds due to interference constraints. Different from the existing literature,\nin order to fully understand the characterization of the s.d.o.f. region of the\nIC, one has to study the 4-user case, i.e., the 2 or 3-user cases do not\nillustrate the generality of the problem. In order to prove the achievability,\nwe use the polytope structure of the converse region. In both MAC and IC cases,\nwe develop explicit schemes that achieve the extreme points of the polytope\nregion given by the converse. Specifically, the extreme points of the MAC\nregion are achieved by an m-user MAC wiretap channel with (K-m) helpers, i.e.,\nby setting (K-m) users' secure rates to zero and utilizing them as pure\n(structured) cooperative jammers. The extreme points of the IC region are\nachieved by a (K-m)-user IC with confidential messages, m helpers, and N\nexternal eavesdroppers, for m>=1 and a finite N. A byproduct of our results in\nthis paper is that the sum s.d.o.f. is achieved only at one extreme point of\nthe s.d.o.f. region, which is the symmetric-rate extreme point, for both MAC\nand IC channel models."

SaaS (different than Software-as-a-Service in this\ncontext) refers to an architectural model in which a cloud provider provides\ndigital storage on their own infrastructure. Three models exist amongst SaaS\nproviders for protecting the confidentiality data stored in the cloud: 1) no\nencryption (data is stored in plain text), 2) server-side encryption (data is\nencrypted once uploaded), and 3) client-side encryption (data is encrypted\nprior to upload).

The\nweaknesses we uncovered primarily center around the fact that the cloud\nproviders we evaluated were each operating in a Certificate Authority capacity\nto facilitate data sharing. In this capacity, they assume the role of both\ncertificate issuer and certificate authorizer as denoted in a Public-Key\nInfrastructure (PKI) scheme - which gives them the ability to view user data\ncontradicting their claims of 100% data confidentiality. We have collated our\nanalysis and findings in this paper and explore some potential solutions to\naddress these weaknesses in these sharing methods.

The\ndesign of ASF reflects lessons learned from the literature on established\nsecurity frameworks (such as Linux Security Modules or the BSD MAC Framework)\nand intertwines them with the particular requirements and challenges from the\ndesign of Android's software stack. ASF provides a novel security API that\nsupports authors of Android security extensions in developing their modules.\nThis overcomes the current unsatisfactory situation to provide security\nsolutions as separate patches to the Android software stack or to embed them\ninto Android's mainline codebase. As a result, ASF provides different practical\nbenefits such as a higher degree of acceptance, adaptation, and maintenance of\nsecurity solutions than previously possible on Android. We present a\nprototypical implementation of ASF and demonstrate its effectiveness and\nefficiency by modularizing different security models from related work, such as\ncontext-aware access control, inlined reference monitoring, and type\nenforcement."

        "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely studied and applied in many fields.\nRecently, the way to perform secure compressive sensing (SCS) has become a\ntopic of growing interest. The existing works on SCS usually take the sensing\nmatrix as a key and the resultant security level is not evaluated in depth.\nThey can only be considered as a preliminary exploration on SCS, but a concrete\nand operable encipher model is not given yet. In this paper, we are going to\ninvestigate SCS in a systematic way. The relationship between CS and\nsymmetric-key cipher indicates some possible encryption models. To this end, we\npropose the two-level protection models (TLPM) for SCS which are developed from\nmeasurements taking and something else, respectively. It is believed that these\nmodels will provide a new point of view and stimulate further research in both\nCS and cryptography. Specifically, an efficient and secure encryption scheme\nfor parallel compressive sensing (PCS) is designed by embedding a two-layer\nprotection in PCS using chaos. The first layer is undertaken by random\npermutation on a two-dimensional signal, which is proved to be an acceptable\npermutation with overwhelming probability. The other layer is to sample the\npermuted signal column by column with the same chaotic measurement matrix,\nwhich satisfies the restricted isometry property of PCS with overwhelming\nprobability. Both the random permutation and the measurement matrix are\nconstructed under the control of a chaotic system. Simulation results show that\nunlike the general joint compression and encryption schemes in which encryption\nalways leads to the same or a lower compression ratio, the proposed approach of\nembedding encryption in PCS actually improves the compression performance.\nBesides, the proposed approach possesses high transmission robustness against\nadditive Gaussian white noise and cropping attack."

Towards the embedding\nprocess, several graph theoretic watermarking algorithmic techniques encode the\nwatermark values as graph structures and embed them in application programs.\nRecently, we presented an efficient codec system for encoding a watermark\nnumber $w$ as a reducible permutation graph $F[\\pi^*]$ through the use of\nself-inverting permutations $\\pi^*$. In this paper, we propose a dynamic\nwatermarking model, which we call WaterRPG, for embedding the watermark graph\n$F[\\pi^*]$ into an application program $P$. The main idea behind the proposed\nwatermarking model is a systematic use of appropriate calls of specific\nfunctions of the program $P$. More precisely, for a specific input $I_{key}$ of\nthe program $P$, our model takes the dynamic call-graph $G(P, I_{key})$ of $P$\nand the watermark graph $F[\\pi^*]$, and produces the watermarked program $P^*$\nhaving the following key property: its dynamic call-graph $G(P^*, I_{key})$ is\nisomorphic to the watermark graph $F[\\pi^*]$. Within this idea the program\n$P^*$ is produced by only altering appropriate calls of specific functions of\nthe input application program $P$. We have implemented our watermarking model\nWaterRPG in real application programs and evaluated its functionality under\nvarious and broadly used watermarking assessment criteria. The evaluation\nresults show that our model efficiently watermarks Java application programs\nwith respect to several watermarking metrics like data-rate, bytecode\ninstructions overhead, resiliency, time and space efficiency.

Previous approaches\nfor protecting networks from DoS attacks are reactive in that they wait for an\nattack to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect the\nnetwork. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more\nsophisticated methods to mask their traffic. A secure overlay services (SOS)\narchitecture has been proposed to provide reliable communication between\nclients and a target under DoS attacks. The SOS architecture employs a set of\noverlay nodes arranged in three hierarchical layers that controls access to the\ntarget. We propose an architecture called secure overlay services (SOS) that\nproactively prevents denial of service (DoS) attacks, which works toward\nsupporting emergency services, or similar types of communication. The\narchitecture uses a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via\nconsistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful\nattacks by: 1) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges,\npushing the attack point into the core of the network, where high-speed routers\ncan handle the volume of attack traffic and 2) introducing randomness and\nanonymity into the forwarding architecture, making it difficult for an attacker\nto target nodes along the path to a specific SOSprotected destination. Using\nsimple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can\nsuccessfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS protected network.

Our analysis revealed a number of very critical flaws that could not\nhave been captured in prior models. We propose fixes for the flaws, formally\nstate relevant security properties, and prove that the fixed system in a\nsetting with a so-called secondary identity provider satisfies these security\nproperties in our model. The fixes for the most critical flaws have already\nbeen adopted by Mozilla and our findings have been rewarded by the Mozilla\nSecurity Bug Bounty Program."

In this paper, a general formal\nframework is proposed for leveraging such heterogeneity to derive optimal\npatching policies that attain the minimum aggregate cost due to the spread of\nmalware and the surcharge of patching. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for\na stratified epidemic model, it is analytically proven that in the mean-field\ndeterministic regime, optimal patch disseminations are simple single-threshold\npolicies. Through numerical simulations, the behavior of optimal patching\npolicies is investigated in sample topologies and their advantages are\ndemonstrated."

This paper proposes a novel approach towards\nenforcing system security by requiring the explicit definition of trust for all\noperating code. By identifying the various classes and levels of trust required\nwithin a computing system; trust is defined as a combination of individual\ncharacteristics. Trust is then represented as a calculable metric obtained\nthrough the collective enforcement of each of these characteristics to varying\ndegrees. System Security is achieved by facilitating trust to be a constantly\nevolving aspect for each operating code segment capable of getting stronger or\nweaker over time."

When the user wants to\nregain access to the account, the service provider sends different verification\ncodes to the user's trustees. The user must obtain at least k (i.e., recovery\nthreshold) verification codes from the trustees before being directed to reset\nhis or her password.\n  In this paper, we provide the first systematic study about the security of\ntrustee-based social authentications.

In these attacks, an\nattacker initially obtains a small number of compromised users, and then the\nattacker iteratively attacks the rest of users by exploiting trustee-based\nsocial authentications.

        "abstract": "Identity federations operating in a business or consumer context need to\nprevent the collection of user data across trust service providers for legal\nand business case reasons. Legal reasons are given by data protection\nlegislation. Other reasons include business owners becoming increasingly aware\nof confidentiality risks that go beyond traditional information security, e.g.,\nthe numbers of authentications to an EDI service might provide insights into\nthe volume of invoices, from which one could derive insider information. This\npaper proposes extended technical controls supporting three privacy\nrequirements: a) Limit d Linkability: Two service providers cannot link data\nrelated to a user without the help of a third party, using neither an\nidentifier nor other identifying attributes like email addresses or payment\ndata; b) Limited Observability: An identity provider cannot trace which\nservices a user is using without the help of a third party; c) Non-Disclosure:\nAttributes provided to the service provider by an attribute provider are not\ndisclosed to the identity provider or an intermediate service broker. Using a\nhub-and-spoke federation style following the privacy-by-design principle, this\nreference architecture addresses the privacy controls mentioned above."

A\nspecific interesting problem is information flow control (IFC) for JavaScript.\nIn this paper, we develop, formalize and implement a dynamic IFC mechanism for\nthe JavaScript engine of a production Web browser (specifically, Safari's\nWebKit engine). Our IFC mechanism works at the level of JavaScript bytecode and\nhence leverages years of industrial effort on optimizing both the source to\nbytecode compiler and the bytecode interpreter. We track both explicit and\nimplicit flows and observe only moderate overhead. Working with bytecode\nresults in new challenges including the extensive use of unstructured control\nflow in bytecode (which complicates lowering of program context taints),\nunstructured exceptions (which complicate the matter further) and the need to\nmake IFC analysis permissive. We explain how we address these challenges,\nformally model the JavaScript bytecode semantics and our instrumentation, prove\nthe standard property of termination-insensitive non-interference, and present\nexperimental results on an optimized prototype."

        "abstract": "The Web Bulletin Board (WBB) is a key component of verifiable election\nsystems. It is used in the context of election verification to publish evidence\nof voting and tallying that voters and officials can check, and where\nchallenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the\nelection authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board\ncorrectly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even\nin the presence of failures and attacks. To ensure robustness, an\nimplementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a\ncorrect service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this\npaper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,\nmotivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a\ndistributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires\ncareful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B\nmodelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design\nagainst an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In\nparticular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving\ncorrectly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board\ndistributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or\ndishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The\nverification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the\nbulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a\npeered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified."

        "abstract": "Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) fall into two high-level categories:\nnetwork-based systems (NIDS) that monitor network behaviors, and host-based\nsystems (HIDS) that monitor system calls. In this work, we present a general\ntechnique for both systems. We use anomaly detection, which identifies patterns\nnot conforming to a historic norm. In both types of systems, the rates of\nchange vary dramatically over time (due to burstiness) and over components (due\nto service difference). To efficiently model such systems, we use continuous\ntime Bayesian networks (CTBNs) and avoid specifying a fixed update interval\ncommon to discrete-time models. We build generative models from the normal\ntraining data, and abnormal behaviors are flagged based on their likelihood\nunder this norm. For NIDS, we construct a hierarchical CTBN model for the\nnetwork packet traces and use Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering to learn the\nparameters. We illustrate the power of our method through experiments on\ndetecting real worms and identifying hosts on two publicly available network\ntraces, the MAWI dataset and the LBNL dataset. For HIDS, we develop a novel\nlearning method to deal with the finite resolution of system log file time\nstamps, without losing the benefits of our continuous time model. We\ndemonstrate the method by detecting intrusions in the DARPA 1998 BSM dataset."

        "abstract": "Sending private messages over communication environments under surveillance\nis an important challenge in communication security and has attracted\nattentions of cryptographers through time. We believe that resources other than\ncryptographic keys can be used for communication privacy. We consider private\nmessage transmission (PMT) in an abstract multipath communication model between\ntwo communicants, Alice and Bob, in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. Alice\nand Bob have pre-shared keys and Eve is computationally unbounded. There are a\ntotal of $n$ paths and the three parties can have simultaneous access to at\nmost $t_a$, $t_b$, and $t_e$ paths. The parties can switch their paths after\nevery $\\lambda$ bits of communication. We study perfect (P)-PMT versus\nasymptotically-perfect (AP)-PMT protocols. The former has zero tolerance of\ntransmission error and leakage, whereas the latter allows for positive error\nand leakage that tend to zero as the message length increases. We derive the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which P-PMT and AP-PMT are possible.\nWe also introduce explicit P-PMT and AP-PMT constructions. Our results show\nAP-PMT protocols attain much higher information rates than P-PMT ones.\nInterestingly, AP-PMT is possible even in poorest condition where $t_a=t_b=1$\nand $t_e=n-1$. It remains however an open question whether the derived rates\ncan be improved by more sophisticated AP-PMT protocols.\n  We study applications of our results to private communication over the\nreal-life scenarios of multiple-frequency links and multiple-route networks. We\nshow practical examples of such scenarios that can be abstracted by the\nmultipath setting: Our results prove the possibility of keyless\ninformation-theoretic private message transmission at rates $17\\%$ and $20\\%$\nfor the two example scenarios, respectively.

        "abstract": "An adversary looking to disrupt a power grid may look to target certain\nsubstations and sources of power generation to initiate a cascading failure\nthat maximizes the number of customers without electricity. This is\nparticularly an important concern when the enemy has the capability to launch\ncyber-attacks as practical concerns (i.e. avoiding disruption of service,\npresence of legacy systems, etc.) may hinder security. Hence, a defender can\nharden the security posture at certain power stations but may lack the time and\nresources to do this for the entire power grid. We model a power grid as a\ngraph and introduce the cascading failure game in which both the defender and\nattacker choose a subset of power stations such as to minimize (maximize) the\nnumber of consumers having access to producers of power. We formalize problems\nfor identifying both mixed and deterministic strategies for both players, prove\ncomplexity results under a variety of different scenarios, identify tractable\ncases, and develop algorithms for these problems. We also perform an\nexperimental evaluation of the model and game on a real-world power grid\nnetwork. Empirically, we noted that the game favors the attacker as he benefits\nmore from increased resources than the defender. Further, the minimax defense\nproduces roughly the same expected payoff as an easy-to-compute deterministic\nload based (DLB) defense when played against a minimax attack strategy.\nHowever, DLB performs more poorly than minimax defense when faced with the\nattacker's best response to DLB. This is likely due to the presence of low-load\nyet high-payoff nodes, which we also found in our empirical analysis."
