        "abstract": "Temporally consistent surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from unstructured point cloud data remains challenging, especially for very long sequences. Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors. Experiments across diverse human and animal datasets demonstrate that Neu-PiG outperforms state-the-art approaches, offering both superior accuracy and scalability to long sequences while running at least 60x faster than existing training-free methods and achieving inference speeds on the same order as heavy pretrained models."

        "abstract": "Modelling rock-fluid interaction requires solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict the flow behaviour and the reactions of the fluid with the rock on the interfaces. Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction."

Our approach combines a narrowband LED array with a coded-exposure-pixel (CEP) camera capable of high-speed, per-pixel exposure control, enabling joint encoding of scene information across space, time, and wavelength within each video frame. Unlike passive snapshot systems that divide light across multiple spectral channels simultaneously and assume no motion during a frame's exposure, Lumosaic actively synchronizes illumination and pixel-wise exposure, improving photon utilization and preserving spectral fidelity under motion. A learning-based reconstruction pipeline then recovers 31-channel hyperspectral (400-700 nm) video at 30 fps and VGA resolution, producing temporally coherent and spectrally accurate reconstructions. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that Lumosaic significantly improves reconstruction fidelity and temporal stability over existing snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems, enabling robust hyperspectral video across diverse materials and motion conditions."

However, existing reconstruction methods are primarily limited to replicating observed scenes and lack the capability for diverse weather simulation. While image-level weather editing methods tend to introduce scene artifacts and offer poor controllability over the weather effects. To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions. Additionally, we design a physics-driven model that simulates dynamic weather effects through particles and motion patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and various scenes demonstrate that WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing. Our framework not only enables fine-grained control over weather conditions (e.g., light rain and heavy snow) but also supports object-level manipulation within the scene."

The model adopts a dual stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture, where one branch synthesizes video and the other generates temporally aligned audio, while sharing a powerful text encoder based on the Multimodal Large Language Models (MMLM). SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models. To our knowledge, SkyReels V4 is the first video foundation model that simultaneously supports multi-modal input, joint video audio generation, and a unified treatment of generation, inpainting, and editing, while maintaining strong efficiency and quality at cinematic resolutions and durations."

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in high-fidelity image, video, and audio generation, yet inference remains computationally expensive. Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\\times$ and $2.07\\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures. Our approach also outperforms existing methods in acceleration under high-resolution synthesis settings. Code is available at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/Hybridiff."

We are the first to introduce phase congruency to colonoscopic domain adaptation and design a cross-level structure constraint to co-optimize geometric structures and fine-grained details like vascular textures. In zero-shot evaluations conducted on a publicly available phantom dataset, the MDE model that was fine-tuned on our generated data achieved a maximum reduction of 44.18% in RMSE compared to competing methods.

        "abstract": "Multi-modal distribution in robotic manipulation action sequences poses critical challenges for imitation learning. To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks. Our work demonstrates that explicit mode-level decoupling enables both robust multi-modal modeling and reactive closed-loop control for robotic manipulation."

Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures. In addition, a cascade attention fusion module is proposed to enhance multi-vehicle information integration. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that QPoint2Comm sets a new state of the art in accuracy, communication efficiency, and resilience to packet loss."

Specifically, an invertible hierarchy flow (IHF) performs hierarchical subtractive coupling to progressively remove artefact-related features, while an artefact-aware normalization (AAN) employs anatomy-fixed feature modulation to accurately transfer target characteristics. Combined with anatomy and artefact consistency loss objectives, IHF-Harmony achieves high-fidelity harmonization that retains source anatomy. Experiments across multiple MRI modalities demonstrate that IHF-Harmony outperforms existing methods in both anatomical fidelity and downstream task performance, facilitating robust harmonization for large-scale multi-site imaging studies.

Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm. Then we propose a scene perception Gaussian management strategy that optimize Gaussians based on joint depth-density information. These designs significantly enhance reconstruction completeness, suppress floating artifacts and improve overall geometric consistency under extreme view sparsity. Experiments on outdoor benchmarks demonstrate substantial gains over existing methods in both fidelity and stability."

While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction. Across these settings, we quantify trade-offs among measurement assimilation, posterior diversity, and physics/statistics fidelity, and establish D-Flow SGLD as a practical FM-compatible posterior sampler for scientific inverse problems."

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation."

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity."

Using a few-shot prompting strategy without fine-tuning, models were assessed on macro-averaged F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity to account for class imbalance. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieved the highest overall performance (median macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it showed the weakest results. Larger models (7B--8B parameters) consistently outperformed smaller counterparts in sensitivity and MCC. A bilingual analysis of Aya-expanse-8B revealed that translating Persian transcripts to English improved sensitivity, reduced missing outputs, and boosted metrics robust to class imbalance, though at the cost of slightly lower specificity and precision. Feature-level results showed reliable extraction of physiological symptoms across most models, whereas psychological complaints, administrative requests, and complex somatic features remained challenging.

However, routine acquisition of multi-tracer PET is limited by high costs, radiation exposure, and restricted tracer availability. Recent efforts have explored deep learning approaches for synthesizing PET images from structural MRI. While some methods rely solely on T1-weighted MRI, others incorporate additional sequences such as T2-FLAIR to improve pathological sensitivity. However, existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained anatomical and pathological details, resulting in artifacts and unrealistic outputs. To this end, we propose RelA-Diffusion, a Relativistic Adversarial Diffusion framework for multi-tracer PET synthesis from multi-sequence MRI. By leveraging both T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR scans as complementary inputs, RelA-Diffusion captures richer structural information to guide image generation. To improve synthesis fidelity, we introduce a gradient-penalized relativistic adversarial loss to the intermediate clean predictions of the diffusion model. This loss compares real and generated images in a relative manner, encouraging the synthesis of more realistic local structures. Both the relativistic formulation and the gradient penalty contribute to stabilizing the training, while adversarial feedback at each diffusion timestep enables consistent refinement throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that RelA-Diffusion outperforms existing methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics, highlighting its potential for accurate synthesis of multi-tracer PET."

We identify six cognitive failure modes in users and find that their risk awareness often fails to translate to protective behavior. The defense analysis reveals that effective warnings should interrupt workflows with low verification costs. With experiential learning based on HAT-Lab, over 90% of users who perceive risks report increased caution against AMD. This work provides empirical evidence and a platform for human-centric agent security research."

        "abstract": "Fast-flying aerial robots promise rapid inspection under limited battery constraints, with direct applications in infrastructure inspection, terrain exploration, and search and rescue. However, high speeds lead to severe motion blur in images and induce significant drift and noise in pose estimates, making dense 3D reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) particularly challenging due to their high sensitivity to such degradations. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages asynchronous event streams alongside motion-blurred frames to reconstruct high-fidelity radiance fields from agile drone flights. By embedding event-image fusion into NeRF optimization and jointly refining event-based visual-inertial odometry priors using both event and frame modalities, our method recovers sharp radiance fields and accurate camera trajectories without ground-truth supervision. We validate our approach on both synthetic data and real-world sequences captured by a fast-flying drone. Despite highly dynamic drone flights, where RGB frames are severely degraded by motion blur and pose priors become unreliable, our method reconstructs high-fidelity radiance fields and preserves fine scene details, delivering a performance gain of over 50% on real-world data compared to state-of-the-art methods."

Traditional photogrammetry achieves exceptional detail but requires extensive camera arrays (25-200+ views), substantial computation, and manual cleanup in challenging areas like facial hair. Recent alternatives present a fundamental trade-off: foundation models enable efficient single-image reconstruction but lack fine geometric detail, while optimization-based methods achieve higher fidelity but require dense views and expensive computation. We bridge this gap with a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method introduces a multi-view surface normal prediction model that extends monocular foundation models with cross-view attention to produce geometrically consistent normals in a feed-forward pass. We then leverage these predictions as strong geometric priors within an inverse rendering optimization framework to recover high-frequency surface details. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-image and multi-view methods, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction on par with dense-view photogrammetry while reducing camera requirements and computational cost. The code and model will be released."

        "abstract": "In engineering design and scientific computing, computational cost and predictive accuracy are intrinsically coupled. High-fidelity simulations provide accurate predictions but at substantial computational costs, while lower-fidelity approximations offer efficiency at the expense of accuracy. Multi-fidelity surrogate modelling addresses this trade-off by combining abundant low-fidelity data with sparse high-fidelity observations. However, existing methods suffer from expensive training cost or rely on global correlation assumptions that often fail in practice to capture how fidelity relationships vary across the input space, leading to poor performance particularly under tight budget constraints. We introduce MAST, a method that blends corrected low-fidelity observations with high-fidelity predictions, trusting high-fidelity near observed samples and relying on corrected low-fidelity elsewhere. MAST achieves this through explicit discrepancy modelling and distance-based weighting with closed-form variance propagation, producing a single heteroscedastic Gaussian process. Across multi-fidelity synthetic benchmarks, MAST shows a marked improvement over the current state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, MAST maintains robust performance across varying total budget and fidelity gaps, conditions under which competing methods exhibit significant degradation or unstable behaviour."

However, we find that leading MLLMs and specialist OCR models largely fail to perceive these structural anomalies, creating a critical bottleneck for both VTR evaluation and RL-based optimization. As a result, even state-of-the-art generators (e.g., SeedDream4.0, Qwen-Image) still struggle to render structurally faithful text. To address this, we propose TextPecker, a plug-and-play structural anomaly perceptive RL strategy that mitigates noisy reward signals and works with any textto-image generator. To enable this capability, we construct a recognition dataset with character-level structural-anomaly annotations and develop a stroke-editing synthesis engine to expand structural-error coverage. Experiments show that TextPecker consistently improves diverse text-to-image models; even on the well-optimized Qwen-Image, it significantly yields average gains of 4% in structural fidelity and 8.7% in semantic alignment for Chinese text rendering, establishing a new state-of-the-art in high-fidelity VTR. Our work fills a gap in VTR optimization, providing a foundational step towards reliable and structural faithful visual text generation."

However, powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques now pose a new threat to these watermarks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrating that diffusion models can effectively erase robust watermarks even when those watermarks were designed to withstand conventional distortions. We show that a diffusion-driven image regeneration process, which leverages generative models to recreate an image, can remove embedded watermarks while preserving the image's perceptual content. Furthermore, we introduce a guided diffusion-based attack that explicitly targets the embedded watermark signal during generation, significantly degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image undergoes sufficient diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the hidden payload approaches zero, leading to inevitable decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art watermarking methods (including deep learning-based schemes like StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate that diffusion edits yield near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative model-based edits, underscoring the need for new strategies to ensure watermark resilience in the era of powerful diffusion models."

Given a set of images captured along a recorded trajectory and the corresponding scene geometry, GA-Drive synthesizes novel pseudo-views using geometry information. These pseudo-views are then transformed into photorealistic views using a trained video diffusion model. In this way, we decouple the geometry and appearance of scenes. An advantage of such decoupling is its support for appearance editing via state-of-the-art video-to-video editing techniques, while preserving the underlying geometry, enabling consistent edits across both original and novel trajectories.

Existing autoregressive approaches struggle with slow token-by-token generation, while prior diffusion-based planners often rely on verbose, general-purpose language tokens that lack explicit geometric structure. In this work, we propose Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion for Autonomous Driving (MVLAD-AD), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between efficient planning and semantic explainability via a masked vision-language-action diffusion model. Unlike methods that force actions into the language space, we introduce a discrete action tokenization strategy that constructs a compact codebook of kinematically feasible waypoints from real-world driving distributions. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware embedding learning to ensure that embeddings in the latent space approximate physical geometric metrics. Finally, an action-priority decoding strategy is introduced to prioritize trajectory generation. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and derived benchmarks demonstrate that MVLAD-AD achieves superior efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in planning precision, while providing high-fidelity and explainable reasoning."

To tackle these issues, we introduce WildGHand, an optimization-based framework that enables self-adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting on in-the-wild videos and produces high-fidelity hand avatars. WildGHand incorporates two key components: (i) a dynamic perturbation disentanglement module that explicitly represents perturbations as time-varying biases on 3D Gaussian attributes during optimization, and (ii) a perturbation-aware optimization strategy that generates per-frame anisotropic weighted masks to guide optimization. Together, these components allow the framework to identify and suppress perturbations across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further curate a dataset of monocular hand videos captured under diverse perturbations to benchmark in-the-wild hand avatar reconstruction. Extensive experiments on this dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that WildGHand achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantially improves over its base model across multiple metrics (e.g., up to a $15.8\\%$ relative gain in PSNR and a $23.1\\%$ relative reduction in LPIPS).

To address this, we propose a LEarnable Stage-Aware (LESA) predictor framework based on two-stage training. Our approach leverages a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to accurately learn temporal feature mappings from data.

We propose SceMoS, a scene-aware motion synthesis framework that shows that structured 2D scene representations can serve as a powerful alternative to full 3D supervision in physically grounded motion synthesis. SceMoS disentangles global planning from local execution using lightweight 2D cues and relying on (1) a text-conditioned autoregressive global motion planner that operates on a bird's-eye-view (BEV) image rendered from an elevated corner of the scene, encoded with DINOv2 features, as the scene representation, and (2) a geometry-grounded motion tokenizer trained via a conditional VQ-VAE, that uses 2D local scene heightmap, thus embedding surface physics directly into a discrete vocabulary. This 2D factorization reaches an efficiency-fidelity trade-off: BEV semantics capture spatial layout and affordance for global reasoning, while local heightmaps enforce fine-grained physical adherence without full 3D volumetric reasoning. SceMoS achieves state-of-the-art motion realism and contact accuracy on the TRUMANS benchmark, reducing the number of trainable parameters for scene encoding by over 50%, showing that 2D scene cues can effectively ground 3D human-scene interaction."

However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality.

MG extrapolates the current velocity using an exponential moving average of past velocities and preserves the standard one-evaluation-per-step cost. It matches the effect of standard guidance without extra computation and can further improve quality when combined with CFG. Experiments demonstrate MG's effectiveness across benchmarks.

Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, but generalization across diverse anatomies is challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. We propose a two-step framework that decouples geometric representation from learning the physics response, to enable shape-informed surrogate modeling under data-scarce conditions. First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds. Overall, our results, obtained on idealized and patient-specific datasets, show that the proposed approaches allow for accurate predictions and generalization to unseen geometries, and robustness to noisy or sparsely sampled inputs."

        "abstract": "Understanding and predicting microstructure evolution is fundamental to materials science, as it governs the resulting properties and performance of materials. Traditional simulation methods, such as phase-field models, offer high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive due to the need to solve complex partial differential equations at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that accelerates microstructure evolution predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes a fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in a self-supervised manner using sequential images generated from simulations of microstructural processes, including grain growth and spinodal decomposition. The trained neural network effectively learns the underlying physical dynamics and can accurately capture both short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties of evolving microstructures, while also demonstrating generalization to unseen spatiotemporal domains and variations in configuration and material parameters. Compared to recurrent neural architectures, our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance with significantly reduced computational cost in both training and inference. This work establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations."

        "abstract": "While diffusion models have shown great potential in portrait generation, generating expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos remains a significant challenge. Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion."

To address this limitation, we establish the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset containing synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 female Saanen goats (6-18 months). Using multi-view DynamicFusion, we fuse noisy, non-rigid point cloud sequences into high-fidelity 3D scans, overcoming challenges from irregular surfaces and rapid movement. Based on these scans, we develop SaanenGoat, a parametric 3D shape model specifically designed for female Saanen goats. This model features a refined template with 41 skeletal joints and enhanced udder representation, registered with our scan data. A comprehensive shape space constructed from 48 goats enables precise representation of diverse individual variations. With the help of SaanenGoat model, we get high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input, and achieve automated measurement of six critical body dimensions: body length, height, chest width, chest girth, hip width, and hip height. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method in both 3D reconstruction and body measurement, presenting a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming."

Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions. Evaluated on a large, multicenter cohort of 7,951 participants, our model achieves a sensitivity of 99.5\\%, a specificity of 97.2\\%, and an area under the curve of 0.987 at a minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), substantially outperforming the average diagnostic accuracy of expert sonographers.

        "abstract": "Key part of robotics, augmented reality, and digital inspection is dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations. Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

        "abstract": "High-dimensional generative modeling is fundamentally a manifold-learning problem: real data concentrate near a low-dimensional structure embedded in the ambient space. Effective generators must therefore balance support fidelity -- placing probability mass near the data manifold -- with sampling efficiency. Diffusion models often capture near-manifold structure but require many iterative denoising steps and can leak off-support; normalizing flows sample in one pass but are limited by invertibility and dimension preservation. We propose MAGT (Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport), a flow-like generator that learns a one-shot, manifold-aligned transport from a low-dimensional base distribution to the data space. Training is performed at a fixed Gaussian smoothing level, where the score is well-defined and numerically stable. We approximate this fixed-level score using a finite set of latent anchor points with self-normalized importance sampling, yielding a tractable objective. MAGT samples in a single forward pass, concentrates probability near the learned support, and induces an intrinsic density with respect to the manifold volume measure, enabling principled likelihood evaluation for generated samples. We establish finite-sample Wasserstein bounds linking smoothing level and score-approximation accuracy to generative fidelity, and empirically improve fidelity and manifold concentration across synthetic and benchmark datasets while sampling substantially faster than diffusion models."

To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios."

We introduce IR3 (Interpretable Reward Reconstruction and Rectification), a framework that reverse-engineers, interprets, and surgically repairs the implicit objectives driving RLHF-tuned models. We propose Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (C-IRL), which reconstructs the implicit reward function by contrasting paired responses from post-alignment and baseline policies to explain behavioral shifts during RLHF. We then decompose the reconstructed reward via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features, enabling identification of hacking signatures through contribution analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies - clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation - that target problematic features while preserving beneficial alignment. Experiments across multiple reward model configurations show that IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of the original model."

Pertinent examples are digital twins (DTs) - high-fidelity, live representations of physical assets, and frequent enablers of corporate digital maturation and transformation. Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models.

In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task. Building on this foundation, we present RefLayer, a simple baseline designed for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition, achieving high visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments show our approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization capabilities."

However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions."

Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework.

To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field.

To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy.

A theoretically grounded and experimentally validated approach allows ChordEdit to deliver fast, lightweight and precise edits, finally achieving true real-time editing on these challenging models."

We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps.

Label-only MIAs, even under strict constraints suffer from high query requirements per sample. We propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction.

This shifts query overhead to a one-time extraction phase, eliminating repeated queries to M . Operating under strict black-box constraints, our method matches the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while significantly reducing query costs.

Existing neural representations, such as NeRFs and 3DGS, excel in appearance reconstruction but struggle to capture complex material deformation and dynamics. We propose PhysConvex, a Physics-informed 3D Dynamic Convex Radiance Field that unifies visual rendering and physical simulation. PhysConvex represents deformable radiance fields using physically grounded convex primitives governed by continuum mechanics. We introduce a boundary-driven dynamic convex representation that models deformation through vertex and surface dynamics, capturing spatially adaptive, non-uniform deformation, and evolving boundaries. To efficiently simulate complex geometries and heterogeneous materials, we further develop a reduced-order convex simulation that advects dynamic convex fields using neural skinning eigenmodes as shape- and material-aware deformation bases with time-varying reduced DOFs under Newtonian dynamics. Convex dynamics also offers compact, gap-free volumetric coverage, enhancing both geometric efficiency and simulation fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that PhysConvex achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and physical properties from videos, outperforming existing methods."

To address this challenge, we propose RobSelf--a fully self-supervised model that is optimized online, requiring no training data, ground-truth supervision, or pre-alignment. RobSelf features two key techniques: a misalignment-aware feature translator and a content-aware reference filter. The translator reformulates unsupervised cross-modal and cross-resolution alignment as a weakly-supervised, misalignment-aware translation subtask, producing an aligned guide feature with inherent redundancy. Guided by this feature, the filter performs reference-based discriminative self-enhancement on the source, enabling SR predictions with high resolution and high fidelity. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that RobSelf achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a real-world dataset, RealMisSR, to advance research on this topic. Dataset and code: https://github.com/palmdong/RobSelf."

        "abstract": "Autonomous robotic systems should reason about resource control and its impact on subsequent maneuvers, especially when operating with limited energy budgets or restricted sensing. Learning-based control is effective in handling complex dynamics and represents the problem as a hybrid action space unifying discrete resource usage and continuous maneuvers. However, prior works on hybrid action space have not sufficiently captured the causal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers. They have also overlooked the multi-modal nature of tactical decisions, both of which are critical in fast-evolving scenarios. In this paper, we propose TART, a Temporal Action Representation learning framework for Tactical resource control and subsequent maneuver generation. TART leverages contrastive learning based on a mutual information objective, designed to capture inherent temporal dependencies in resource-maneuver interactions. These learned representations are quantized into discrete codebook entries that condition the policy, capturing recurring tactical patterns and enabling multi-modal and temporally coherent behaviors. We evaluate TART in two domains where resource deployment is critical: (i) a maze navigation task where a limited budget of discrete actions provides enhanced mobility, and (ii) a high-fidelity air combat simulator in which an F-16 agent operates weapons and defensive systems in coordination with flight maneuvers. Across both domains, TART consistently outperforms hybrid-action baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging limited resources and producing context-aware subsequent maneuvers."

Models take both as input, using the intermediate representation as structural cues while being evaluated against the reference rendering, which tests robustness to intermediate representation defects rather than literal adherence.\n  1D-Bench requires generating an executable React codebase under a fixed toolchain with an explicit component hierarchy, and defines a multi-round setting in which models iteratively apply component-level edits using execution feedback. Experiments on commercial and open-weight multimodal models show that iterative editing generally improves final performance by increasing rendering success and often improving visual similarity. We further conduct a pilot study on post-training with synthetic repair trajectories and reinforcement learning based editing, and observe limited and unstable gains that may stem from sparse terminal rewards and high-variance file-level updates."

Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance."

While machine learning-based surrogate models offer fast inference as a promising alternative, they suffer from degraded accuracy, particularly evaluated on complex urban layouts or out-of-distribution scenarios. Moreover, autoregressive prediction strategies in such models are prone to error accumulation over long forecasting horizons, limiting their robustness for extended-time simulations. To address these limitations, we propose RGD-Blast, a robust and generalizable deep surrogate model for high-fidelity, long-term blast wave forecasting. RGD-Blast incorporates a multi-scale module to capture both global flow patterns and local boundary interactions, effectively mitigating error accumulation during autoregressive prediction. We introduce a dynamic-static feature coupling mechanism that fuses time-varying pressure fields with static source and layout features, thereby enhancing out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RGD-Blast achieves a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over traditional numerical methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. In generalization tests on unseen building layouts, the model achieves an average RMSE below 0.01 and an R2 exceeding 0.89 over 280 consecutive time steps. Additional evaluations under varying blast source locations and explosive charge weights further validate its generalization, substantially advancing the state of the art in long-term blast wave modeling."

We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries."

We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate. Together, these components enable substantial acceleration while preserving generation fidelity. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to $5.54\\times$ latency reduction across various DiT-based image and video generation models, while incurring negligible quality degradation."

Furthermore, a dual-discriminator framework is introduced, employing a temporal discriminator to enforce motion consistency alongside spatial realism. Experiments on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4$\\times$ upscaling demonstrate that PESTGAN establishes a better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality.

Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."

Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment."

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency.

To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy."

By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data."

Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch.

We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

        "abstract": "Advances in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate, high-throughput characterization of agricultural produce quality and plant phenotypes, both essential for advancing agricultural sustainability and breeding programs. HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows."

Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing."

Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences."

Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM 4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37% to 36.76% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4% on Tau2-Bench Retail, and +6.8% on Tool Decathlon (Pass@1).

While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications."

        "abstract": "Reliable spacecraft attitude control depends on accurate prediction of attitude dynamics, particularly when model-based strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are employed, where performance is limited by the quality of the internal system model. For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction."

We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements."

Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state."

It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity.

Here, we introduce Uni-Flow, a unified autoregressive-diffusion framework that explicitly separates temporal evolution from spatial refinement for modelling complex dynamical systems. The autoregressive component learns low-resolution latent dynamics that preserve large-scale structure and ensure stable long-horizon rollouts, while the diffusion component reconstructs high-resolution physical fields, recovering fine-scale features in a small number of denoising steps. We validate Uni-Flow across canonical benchmarks, including two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, three-dimensional turbulent channel inflow generation with a quantum-informed autoregressive prior, and patient-specific simulations of aortic coarctation derived from high-fidelity lattice Boltzmann hemodynamic solvers. In the cardiovascular setting, Uni-Flow enables task-level faster than real-time inference of pulsatile hemodynamics, reconstructing high-resolution pressure fields over physiologically relevant time horizons in seconds rather than hours. By transforming high-fidelity hemodynamic simulation from an offline, HPC-bound process into a deployable surrogate, Uni-Flow establishes a pathway to faster-than-real-time modelling of complex multiscale flows, with broad implications for scientific machine learning in flow physics."

Consequently, the fundamental question of \\textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered.

In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

This paper introduces an assurance-oriented AIaaS management plane based on Tail-Risk Envelopes (TREs): signed, composable per-domain descriptors that combine deterministic guardrails with stochastic rate-latency-impairment models. Using stochastic network calculus, we derive bounds on end-to-end delay violation probabilities across tandem domains and obtain an optimization-ready risk-budget decomposition. We show that tenant-level reservations prevent bursty traffic from inflating tail latency under TRE contracts. An auditing layer then uses runtime telemetry to estimate extreme-percentile performance, quantify uncertainty, and attribute tail-risk to each domain for accountability. Packet-level Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate improved p99.9 compliance under overload via admission control and robust tenant isolation under correlated burstiness."

        "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models. The DRR paradigm offers an effective strategy for building powerful and practical neural field surrogates and \\rev{INRs in broader applications}, with a minimal compromise between speed and quality."

In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation."

Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time."

Gradient enhancement of PINNs dictates that the PDE residual is taken to a higher differential order than prescribed by the PDE, added to the objective as an augmented term in order to improve training and overall learning fidelity. We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay. Our methods are fast and efficient. Our methods oftentimes achieve superior PINN versus numerical error in fewer training iterations, potentially pair well with few samples in collocation, and can on occasion break plateaus in low collocation settings. Moreover, our methods are suitable for fractional derivatives. We establish that our methods improve spectral eigenvalue decay of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), and so our methods contribute towards the learning of high frequencies in early training, mitigating the effects of frequency bias up to the polynomial order and possibly greater with smooth activations. Our methods accommodate advanced techniques in PINNs, such as Fourier feature embeddings. A pitfall of discrete Fourier transforms via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is mesh subjugation, and so we demonstrate compatibility of our methods for greater mesh flexibility and invariance on alternative Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains via Monte Carlo methods and otherwise."

In this paper, we present S-PRESSO, a 48kHz sound effect compression model that produces both continuous and discrete embeddings at ultra-low bitrates, down to 0.096 kbps, via offline quantization. Our model relies on a pretrained latent diffusion model to decode compressed audio embeddings learned by a latent encoder. Leveraging the generative priors of the diffusion decoder, we achieve extremely low frame rates, down to 1Hz (750x compression rate), producing convincing and realistic reconstructions at the cost of exact fidelity. Despite operating at high compression rates, we demonstrate that S-PRESSO outperforms both continuous and discrete baselines in audio quality, acoustic similarity and reconstruction metrics."

Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency. We will open-source the code, models, training data, and reward data for community research purposes."

        "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls."

        "abstract": "Recent multi-modal video generation models have achieved high visual quality, but their prohibitive latency and limited temporal stability hinder real-time deployment. Streaming inference exacerbates these issues, leading to pronounced multimodal degradation, such as spatial blurring, temporal drift, and lip desynchronization, which creates an unresolved efficiency-performance trade-off. To this end, we propose EchoTorrent, a novel schema with a fourfold design: (1) Multi-Teacher Training fine-tunes a pre-trained model on distinct preference domains to obtain specialized domain experts, which sequentially transfer domain-specific knowledge to a student model; (2) Adaptive CFG Calibration (ACC-DMD), which calibrates the audio CFG augmentation errors in DMD via a phased spatiotemporal schedule, eliminating redundant CFG computations and enabling single-pass inference per step; (3) Hybrid Long Tail Forcing, which enforces alignment exclusively on tail frames during long-horizon self-rollout training via a causal-bidirectional hybrid architecture, effectively mitigates spatiotemporal degradation in streaming mode while enhancing fidelity to reference frames; and (4) VAE Decoder Refiner through pixel-domain optimization of the VAE decoder to recover high-frequency details while circumventing latent-space ambiguities. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with substantially extended temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization."

This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly applied to question-answering over long academic papers, where accurate evidence allocation under a fixed token budget is critical. Existing approaches typically flatten academic papers into unstructured chunks during preprocessing, which destroys the native hierarchical structure. This loss forces retrieval to operate in a disordered space, thereby producing fragmented contexts, misallocating tokens to non-evidential regions under finite token budgets, and increasing the reasoning burden for downstream language models. To address these issues, we propose PT-RAG, an RAG framework that treats the native hierarchical structure of academic papers as a low-entropy retrieval prior. PT-RAG first inherits the native hierarchy to construct a structure-fidelity PaperTree index, which prevents entropy increase at the source. It then designs a path-guided retrieval mechanism that aligns query semantics to relevant sections and selects high relevance root-to-leaf paths under a fixed token budget, yielding compact, coherent, and low-entropy retrieval contexts. In contrast to existing RAG approaches, PT-RAG avoids entropy increase caused by destructive preprocessing and provides a native low-entropy structural basis for subsequent retrieval. To assess this design, we introduce entropy-based structural diagnostics that quantify retrieval fragmentation and evidence allocation accuracy. On three academic question-answering benchmarks, PT-RAG achieves consistently lower section entropy and evidence alignment cross entropy than strong baselines, indicating reduced context fragmentation and more precise allocation to evidential regions. These structural advantages directly translate into higher answer quality."

        "abstract": "The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed."

An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines."

        "abstract": "Computation in biological systems is fundamentally energy-constrained, yet standard theories of computation treat energy as freely available. Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the *coding rate* -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the *firing rate* -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder (P-VAE) -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of *sparse coding* as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient $\u03b2$ and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing $\u03b2$ monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation."

        "abstract": "Radiological diagnosis is a perceptual process in which careful visual inspection and language reasoning are repeatedly interleaved. Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist."

However, the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds poses challenges to reconstruction accuracy. This limitation frequently causes high-frequency detail loss in complex surface microstructures when relying solely on routine strategies. To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions. The reconstruction quality is enhanced through adaptive filtering mechanisms guided by depth discrepancy features. This preserves high-weight regions while implementing a dual-branch constraint strategy tailored to regional texture variations, thereby improving geometric detail characterization. For multi-view optimization, we introduce a geometry-guided cross-view point cloud association method combined with a dynamic weight sampling strategy. This constructs 3D structural normal constraints across adjacent point cloud frames, effectively reinforcing multi-view consistency and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves both competitive rendering quality and geometric reconstruction. See our interactive project page"

Recent training-free approaches have attempted to overcome this constraint by introducing interventions during the denoising process; however, these methods incur substantial computational overhead, often requiring more than five minutes to produce a single 4K image. In this paper, we present PixelRush, the first tuning-free framework for practical high-resolution text-to-image generation. Our method builds upon the established patch-based inference paradigm but eliminates the need for multiple inversion and regeneration cycles. Instead, PixelRush enables efficient patch-based denoising within a low-step regime. To address artifacts introduced by patch blending in few-step generation, we propose a seamless blending strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate over-smoothing effects through a noise injection mechanism. PixelRush delivers exceptional efficiency, generating 4K images in approximately 20 seconds representing a 10$\\times$ to 35$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining superior visual fidelity. Extensive experiments validate both the performance gains and the quality of outputs achieved by our approach."

We introduce \\textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations.

Traditional approaches, such as static and dynamic analysis, extract valuable insights from stripped binaries, but often demand substantial expertise and manual effort. Recent advances in deep learning have opened promising opportunities to enhance binary analysis by capturing latent features and disclosing underlying code semantics. Despite the growing number of binary analysis models based on machine learning, their robustness to adversarial code transformations at the binary level remains underexplored. We evaluate the robustness of deep learning models for the task of binary code similarity detection (BCSD) under semantics-preserving transformations. The unique nature of machine instructions presents distinct challenges compared to the typical input perturbations found in other domains. We introduce asmFooler, a system that evaluates the resilience of BCSD models using a diverse set of adversarial code transformations that preserve functional semantics. We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions."

By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint. These results indicate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning."

However, their iterative sampling process, which gradually morphs random noise into coherent images, introduces significant latency that limits their applicability. While recent few-step diffusion models reduce the number of sampling steps to as few as one to four steps, they often compromise image quality and prompt alignment, especially in one-step generation. Additionally, these models require computationally expensive training procedures. To address these limitations, we propose ImageRAGTurbo, a novel approach to efficiently finetune few-step diffusion models via retrieval augmentation. Given a text prompt, we retrieve relevant text-image pairs from a database and use them to condition the generation process. We argue that such retrieved examples provide rich contextual information to the UNet denoiser that helps reduce the number of denoising steps without compromising image quality. Indeed, our initial investigations show that using the retrieved content to edit the denoiser's latent space ($\\mathcal{H}$-space) without additional finetuning already improves prompt fidelity. To further improve the quality of the generated images, we augment the UNet denoiser with a trainable adapter in the $\\mathcal{H}$-space, which efficiently blends the retrieved content with the target prompt using a cross-attention mechanism. Experimental results on fast text-to-image generation demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity images without compromising latency compared to existing methods."

To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models.

Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task performance, personalization quality, and robustness to noisy as well as to sparse preference signals."

        "abstract": "Recent progress in large models has led to significant advances in unified multimodal generation and understanding. However, the development of models that unify motion-language generation and understanding remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches often fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on paired motion-text data, which can result in catastrophic forgetting of linguistic capabilities due to the limited scale of available text-motion pairs. Furthermore, prior methods typically convert motion into discrete representations via quantization to integrate with language models, introducing substantial jitter artifacts from discrete tokenization. To address these challenges, we propose LLaMo, a unified framework that extends pretrained LLMs through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. This design inherently preserves the language understanding of the base model while enabling scalable multimodal adaptation. We encode human motion into a causal continuous latent space and maintain the next-token prediction paradigm in the decoder-only backbone through a lightweight flow-matching head, allowing for streaming motion generation in real-time (>30 FPS). Leveraging the comprehensive language understanding of pretrained LLMs and large-scale motion-text pretraining, our experiments demonstrate that LLaMo achieves high-fidelity text-to-motion generation and motion-to-text captioning in general settings, especially zero-shot motion generation, marking a significant step towards a general unified motion-language large model."

Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage. Experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale custom dataset demonstrate that LatentAM attains significantly better feature reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving near-real-time speed (12-35 FPS) on the evaluated datasets.

Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems."

        "abstract": "Background The accuracy of photomechanics measurements critically relies on image quality,particularly under extreme illumination conditions such as welding arc monitoring and polished metallic surface analysis. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate."

To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead."

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

Next, we demonstrate that applying Contrastive Activation Addition and Sparse Autoencoders in these layers enables more precise control over the generated audio, indicating a direct benefit of the specialization phenomenon. By steering activations of the identified layers, we can alter specific musical elements with high precision, such as modulating tempo or changing a track's mood."

By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness."

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate."

We introduce three primary contributions: (1) A multi-path transport protocol utilizing $(n, k)$ erasure codes, which is demonstrated to counteract the high link volatility and intermittent connectivity that renders standard mix-networks unreliable. (2) The integration of a computationally efficient Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol during route discovery. (3) The introduction of adaptive, centrality-based delay strategies that efficiently mitigate the inherent topological bias of LEO networks, providing a superior anonymity-to-latency trade-off. This mechanism provably prevents metadata leakage at the user-provider directory, mitigating profiling and correlation attacks. We validate this architecture via high-fidelity, packet-level simulations of a LEO constellation. Empirical results show our multi-path transport achieves near-zero message loss, establishing a quantifiable trade-off between reliability and bandwidth overhead. Furthermore, microbenchmarks of the PIR protocol quantify its computational and latency overheads, confirming its feasibility for practical deployment.

By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks.

Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints."

However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360\u00b0-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360\u00b0 full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360\u00b0 consistency without per-instance optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in 360\u00b0 full-head completeness while robustly preserving identity across different viewpoints."

Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality, yet ultra-high-resolution (UHR) video generation remains a formidable challenge due to the compounded difficulties of motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{LUVE}, a \\textbf{L}atent-cascaded \\textbf{U}HR \\textbf{V}ideo generation framework built upon dual frequency \\textbf{E}xperts. LUVE employs a three-stage architecture comprising low-resolution motion generation for motion-consistent latent synthesis, video latent upsampling that performs resolution upsampling directly in the latent space to mitigate memory and computational overhead, and high-resolution content refinement that integrates low-frequency and high-frequency experts to jointly enhance semantic coherence and fine-grained detail generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in UHR video generation, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for training Mobile GUI Agents, yet it struggles with the temporal credit assignment problem inherent in long-horizon tasks. A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks."

        "abstract": "Existing mainstream video customization methods focus on generating identity-consistent videos based on given reference images and textual prompts. Benefiting from the rapid advancement of joint audio-video generation, this paper proposes a more compelling new task: sync audio-video customization, which aims to synchronously customize both video identity and audio timbre. Specifically, given a reference image $I^{r}$ and a reference audio $A^{r}$, this novel task requires generating videos that maintain the identity of the reference image while imitating the timbre of the reference audio, with spoken content freely specifiable through user-provided textual prompts. To this end, we propose OmniCustom, a powerful DiT-based audio-video customization framework that can synthesize a video following reference image identity, audio timbre, and text prompts all at once in a zero-shot manner. Our framework is built on three key contributions. First, identity and audio timbre control are achieved through separate reference identity and audio LoRA modules that operate through self-attention layers within the base audio-video generation model. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective alongside the standard flow matching objective. It uses predicted flows conditioned on reference inputs as positive examples and those without reference conditions as negative examples, thereby enhancing the model ability to preserve identity and timbre. Third, we train OmniCustom on our constructed large-scale, high-quality audio-visual human dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniCustom outperforms existing methods in generating audio-video content with consistent identity and timbre fidelity.

        "abstract": "Back pain is a pervasive issue affecting a significant portion of the population, often worsened by certain movements of the lower back. Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic. High-fidelity data from motion capture sensors can be used to classify different movements, but these sensors are costly and impractical for use in free-living environments. Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features. This combination of synthetic data generation and feature augmentation enables MT-AIM to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis."

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring."

However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular \"right\" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience."

While prior studies have assessed their fidelity in capturing synoptic-scale atmospheric dynamics, their performance across timescales and under out-of-distribution forcing, such as +3K or +4K uniform-warming forcings, and the sources of biases remain elusive, to establish the model reliability for Earth science. Here, we design three sets of experiments targeting synoptic-scale phenomena, interannual variability, and out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings. We evaluate the Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid model integrating a dynamical core with ML-based component, against observations and physics-based Earth system models (ESMs). At the synoptic scale, NeuralGCM captures the evolution and propagation of extratropical cyclones with performance comparable to ESMs. At the interannual scale, when forced by El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, NeuralGCM successfully reproduces associated teleconnection patterns but exhibits deficiencies in capturing nonlinear response. Under out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings, NeuralGCM simulates similar responses in global-average temperature and precipitation and reproduces large-scale tropospheric circulation features similar to those in ESMs. Notable weaknesses include overestimating the tracks and spatial extent of extratropical cyclones, biases in the teleconnected wave train triggered by tropical SST anomalies, and differences in upper-level warming and stratospheric circulation responses to SST warming compared to physics-based ESMs. The causes of these weaknesses were explored."

        "abstract": "We introduce Renet, a principled generalization of the Relaxed Lasso to the Elastic Net family of estimators. While, on the one hand, $\\ell_1$-regularization is a standard tool for variable selection in high-dimensional regimes and, on the other hand, the $\\ell_2$ penalty provides stability and solution uniqueness through strict convexity, the standard Elastic Net nevertheless suffers from shrinkage bias that frequently yields suboptimal prediction accuracy. We propose to address this limitation through a framework called \\textit{relaxation}. Existing relaxation implementations rely on naive linear interpolations of penalized and unpenalized solutions, which ignore the non-linear geometry that characterizes the entire regularization path and risk violating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Renet addresses these limitations by enforcing sign consistency through an adaptive relaxation procedure that dynamically dispatches between convex blending and efficient sub-path refitting. Furthermore, we identify and formalize a unique synergy between relaxation and the ``One-Standard-Error'' rule: relaxation serves as a robust debiasing mechanism, allowing practitioners to leverage the parsimony of the 1-SE rule without the traditional loss in predictive fidelity. Our theoretical framework incorporates automated stability safeguards for ultra-high dimensional regimes and is supported by a comprehensive benchmarking suite across 20 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Renet consistently outperforms the standard Elastic Net and provides a more robust alternative to the Adaptive Elastic Net in high-dimensional, low signal-to-noise ratio and high-multicollinearity regimes. By leveraging an adaptive solver backend, Renet delivers these statistical gains while offering a computational profile that remains competitive with state-of-the-art coordinate descent implementations."

Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow."

We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics.

To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations.

In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models."

There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\u0398((\\varepsilon \u03b2)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\u03b2$ is the accuracy tolerance.

Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $\u0394R^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$).

        "abstract": "Generating 3D content from a single image remains a fundamentally challenging and ill-posed problem due to the inherent absence of geometric and textural information in occluded regions. While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a standard for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, yet its adoption in multiple critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability of the generation models as well as classification of the Splats. While explainability methods exist for other 3D representations, like point clouds, they typically rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives. We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples, enabling intuitive ``this looks like that'' reasoning without any degradation in classification performance. A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios.

We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge. Code: https://github.com/amandpkr/RJF"

While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity. We couple this advance with a GPU-optimized PyTorch implementation and a suite of benchmark experiments demonstrating the benefits of WildCat for image generation, image classification, and language model KV cache compression."

However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image.

Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed. In contrast, when using polyhedral distances for instance, the number of required queries grows linearly with the dimension of the data space. For robust counterfactuals, the latter number of queries doubles. Consequently, the applied distance function and robustness of counterfactuals have a significant impact on the model's security."

However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos."

To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes.

However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks."

Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery."

Existing methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality (NCC~$\\leq 0.96$). We propose PCReg-Net, a progressive contrast-guided registration framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment through four lightweight modules: (1)~a registration U-Net for coarse alignment, (2)~a reference feature extractor capturing multi-scale structural cues, (3)~a contrast module that identifies residual misalignment by comparing coarse-registered and reference features, and (4)~a refinement U-Net with feature injection for high-fidelity output. We further propose the Temporal NCC (TNCC) and Temporal NCC Gap (TNCG) for reference-free evaluation of inter-frame temporal consistency. On OR-PAM-Reg-4K (432 test samples), PCReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.983, SSIM of 0.982, and PSNR of 46.96 dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 14 dB at real-time speed.

        "abstract": "We study instruction-based image editing under professional workflows and identify three persistent challenges: (i) editors often over-edit, modifying content beyond the user's intent; (ii) existing models are largely single-turn, while multi-turn edits can alter object faithfulness; and (iii) evaluation at around 1K resolution is misaligned with real workflows that often operate on ultra high-definition images (e.g., 4K). We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks. We hope this work advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing and its integration into real workflows."

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

        "abstract": "Accurate simulation of turbulent flows is fundamental to scientific and engineering applications. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) offers the highest fidelity but is computationally prohibitive, while existing data-driven alternatives struggle with stable long-horizon rollouts, physical consistency, and faithful simulation of small-scale structures. These challenges are particularly acute in three-dimensional (3D) settings, where the cubic growth of spatial degrees of freedom dramatically amplifies computational cost, memory demand, and the difficulty of capturing multi-scale interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Physics-Enhanced Swin Transformer (PEST) for 3D turbulence simulation. PEST leverages a window-based self-attention mechanism to effectively model localized PDE interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. We introduce a frequency-domain adaptive loss that explicitly emphasizes small-scale structures, enabling more faithful simulation of high-frequency dynamics. To improve physical consistency, we incorporate Navier--Stokes residual constraints and divergence-free regularization directly into the learning objective. Extensive experiments on two representative turbulent flow configurations demonstrate that PEST achieves accurate, physically consistent, and stable autoregressive long-term simulations, outperforming existing data-driven baselines."

        "abstract": "While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://world-arena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08880v1",
        "abstract": "Designing high-fidelity quantum circuits remains challenging, and current paradigms often depend on heuristic, fixed-ansatz structures or rule-based compilers that can be suboptimal or lack generality. We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework that reframes quantum circuit design as a differentiable logic programming problem. Our model represents a scaffold of potential quantum gates and parameterized operations as a set of learnable, continuous ``truth values'' or ``switches,'' $s \\in [0, 1]^N$. These switches are optimized via standard gradient descent to satisfy a user-defined set of differentiable, logical axioms (e.g., correctness, simplicity, robustness). We provide a theoretical formulation bridging continuous logic (via T-norms) and unitary evolution (via geodesic interpolation), while addressing the barren plateau problem through biased initialization. We illustrate the approach on tasks including discovery of a 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) from a scaffold of 21 candidate gates. We also report a hardware-aware adaptation experiment on the 133-qubit IBM Torino processor, where the method improved fidelity by 59.3 percentage points in a localized routing task while adapting to hardware failures."

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT), but practical constraints, such as patient discomfort, long scan times, and high costs often lead to incomplete modalities in clinical practice, compromising RT planning accuracy. Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts. Meanwhile, its unified representation enhances downstream RT-relevant tasks (e.g., segmentation). This work advances digital medicine solutions for NPC care by leveraging foundation models to bridge technical synthesis and clinical utility."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08620v1",
        "abstract": "Recent work leverages Vision Foundation Models as image encoders to boost the generative performance of latent diffusion models (LDMs), as their semantic feature distributions are easy to learn. However, such semantic features often lack low-level information (\\eg, color and texture), leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity, which has emerged as a primary bottleneck in further scaling LDMs. To address this limitation, we propose LV-RAE, a representation autoencoder that augments semantic features with missing low-level information, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction while remaining highly aligned with the semantic distribution. We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality.
