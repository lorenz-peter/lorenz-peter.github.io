        "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority."

Although general locomotion policies demonstrate capabilities across broad terrain distributions, they often struggle with arbitrary and highly challenging environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-to-sim-to-real framework that leverages rapid test-time training (TTT) on novel terrains, significantly enhancing the robot's capability to traverse extremely difficult geometries. We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams. The whole pipeline of capturing, reconstructing, and test-time training requires less than 10 minutes on most tested terrains. Extensive experiments show that the policy after test-time training exhibits robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability."

        "abstract": "High-fidelity generative models have narrowed the perceptual gap between synthetic and real images, posing serious threats to media security. Most existing AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors rely on artifact-based classification and struggle to generalize to evolving generative traces. In contrast, human judgment relies on stable real-world regularities, with deviations from the human cognitive manifold serving as a more generalizable signal of forgery. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate AIGI detection as a Reference-Comparison problem that verifies consistency with the real-image manifold rather than fitting specific forgery cues. We propose MIRROR (Manifold Ideal Reference ReconstructOR), a framework that explicitly encodes reality priors using a learnable discrete memory bank. MIRROR projects an input into a manifold-consistent ideal reference via sparse linear combination, and uses the resulting residuals as robust detection signals. To evaluate whether detectors reach the \"superhuman crossover\" required to replace human experts, we introduce the Human-AIGI benchmark, featuring a psychophysically curated human-imperceptible subset. Across 14 benchmarks, MIRROR consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving gains of 2.1% on six standard benchmarks and 8.1% on seven in-the-wild benchmarks. On Human-AIGI, MIRROR reaches 89.6% accuracy across 27 generators, surpassing both lay users and visual experts, and further approaching the human perceptual limit as pretrained backbones scale.

We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function."

We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values."

Standard models that optimize pixel-wise losses are prone to regression-to-the-mean bias, which blurs extreme values. Existing Fourier-based methods also lack the spatial localization needed to resolve transient convective cells. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose WADEPre, a wavelet-based decomposition model for extreme precipitation that transitions the modeling into the wavelet domain. By leveraging the Discrete Wavelet Transform for explicit decomposition, WADEPre employs a dual-branch architecture: an Approximation Network to model stable, low-frequency advection, isolating deterministic trends from statistical bias, and a spatially localized Detail Network to capture high-frequency stochastic convection, resolving transient singularities and preserving sharp boundaries. A subsequent Refiner module then dynamically reconstructs these decoupled multi-scale components into the final high-fidelity forecast. To address optimization instability, we introduce a multi-scale curriculum learning strategy that progressively shifts supervision from coarse scales to fine-grained details. Extensive experiments on the SEVIR and Shanghai Radar datasets demonstrate that WADEPre achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant improvements in capturing extreme thresholds and maintaining structural fidelity.

To address these issues, we present UrbanGS, a scalable reconstruction framework that effectively tackles these challenges for city-scale applications. First, we propose a Depth-Consistent D-Normal Regularization module. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on monocular normal estimators, which can effectively update rotation parameters yet struggle to update position parameters, our method integrates D-Normal constraints with external depth supervision. This allows for comprehensive updates of all geometric parameters. By further incorporating an adaptive confidence weighting mechanism based on gradient consistency and inverse depth deviation, our approach significantly enhances multi-view depth alignment and geometric coherence, which effectively resolves the issue of geometric accuracy in complex large-scale scenes. To improve scalability, we introduce a Spatially Adaptive Gaussian Pruning (SAGP) strategy, which dynamically adjusts Gaussian density based on local geometric complexity and visibility to reduce redundancy. Additionally, a unified partitioning and view assignment scheme is designed to eliminate boundary artifacts and optimize computational load. Extensive experiments on multiple urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGS achieves superior performance in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and memory efficiency, providing a systematic solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction."

OpticalDNA renders DNA into structured visual layouts and trains an OCR-capable vision--language model with a \\emph{visual DNA encoder} and a \\emph{document decoder}, where the encoder produces compact, reconstructible visual tokens for high-fidelity compression. Building on this representation, OpticalDNA defines prompt-conditioned objectives over core genomic primitives-reading, region grounding, subsequence retrieval, and masked span completion-thereby learning layout-aware DNA representations that retain fine-grained genomic information under a reduced effective token budget. Across diverse genomic benchmarks, OpticalDNA consistently outperforms recent baselines; on sequences up to 450k bases, it achieves the best overall performance with nearly $20\\times$ fewer effective tokens, and surpasses models with up to $985\\times$ more activated parameters while tuning only 256k \\emph{trainable} parameters."

Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

These limitations hinder efficient and controllable image and video editing. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical proxy-based parametric image representation that disentangles semantic, geometric, and textural attributes into independent and manipulable parameter spaces. Based on a semantic-aware decomposition of the input image, our representation constructs hierarchical proxy geometries through adaptive Bezier fitting and iterative internal region subdivision and meshing. Multi-scale implicit texture parameters are embedded into the resulting geometry-aware distributed proxy nodes, enabling continuous high-fidelity reconstruction in the pixel domain and instance- or part-independent semantic editing. In addition, we introduce a locality-adaptive feature indexing mechanism to ensure spatial texture coherence, which further supports high-quality background completion without relying on generative models. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and editing benchmarks, including ImageNet, OIR-Bench, and HumanEdit, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity with significantly fewer parameters, while enabling intuitive, interactive, and physically plausible manipulation. Moreover, by integrating proxy nodes with Position-Based Dynamics, our framework supports real-time physics-driven animation using lightweight implicit rendering, achieving superior temporal consistency and visual realism compared with generative approaches."

DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models.

While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis."

Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution.

        "abstract": "Spherical surface parameterization is a fundamental tool in geometry processing and imaging science. For a genus-0 closed surface, many efficient algorithms can map the surface to the sphere; consequently, a broad class of task-driven genus-0 mapping problems can be reduced to constructing a high-quality spherical self-map. However, existing approaches often face a trade-off between satisfying task objectives (e.g., landmark or feature alignment), maintaining bijectivity, and controlling geometric distortion. We introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the sphere, and establish its correspondence with spherical homeomorphisms up to conformal automorphisms. Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), we propose a neural optimization framework BOOST that optimizes two Beltrami fields on hemispherical stereographic charts and enforces global consistency through explicit seam-aware constraints. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further apply the method to brain cortical surface registration, aligning sulcal landmarks and jointly matching cortical sulci depth maps, showing improved task fidelity with controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior."

        "abstract": "Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) World Models (WMs) offer a promising path for improving mobile GUI agent performance at train- and inference-time. However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance."

While empirical techniques, such as positional encoding (PE), sinusoidal activations (SIREN), and batch normalization (BN), effectively mitigate this, their theoretical justifications are predominantly post hoc, focusing on the global NTK spectrum only after modifications are applied. In this work, we reverse this paradigm by introducing a structural diagnostic framework. By performing a layer-wise decomposition of the NTK, we mathematically identify the ``Inlet Rank Collapse'': a phenomenon where the low-dimensional input coordinates fail to span the high-dimensional embedding space, creating a fundamental rank deficiency at the first layer that acts as an expressive bottleneck for the entire network. This framework provides a unified perspective to re-interpret PE, SIREN, and BN as different forms of rank restoration. Guided by this diagnosis, we derive a Rank-Expanding Initialization, a minimalist remedy that ensures the representation rank scales with the layer width without architectural modifications or computational overhead. Our results demonstrate that this principled remedy enables standard MLPs to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, proving that the key to empowering INRs lies in the structural optimization of the initial rank propagation to effectively populate the latent space."

Specifically, MarkCleaner is trained with micro-geometry-perturbed supervision, which encourages the model to separate semantic content from strict spatial alignment and enables robust reconstruction under subtle geometric displacements. The framework adopts a mask-guided encoder that learns explicit spatial representations and a 2D Gaussian Splatting-based decoder that explicitly parameterizes geometric perturbations while preserving semantic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MarkCleaner achieves superior performance in both watermark removal effectiveness and visual fidelity, while enabling efficient real-time inference.

However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting."

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), promising to accelerate simulations, improve turbulence modelling, and enable real-time flow prediction and control-capabilities that could fundamentally change how engineers approach fluid dynamics problems. However, the exploration of ML in fluid dynamics is critically hampered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and high-fidelity datasets suitable for training robust models. This limitation is particularly acute for highly turbulent flows, which dominate practical engineering applications yet remain computationally prohibitive to simulate at scale. High-Reynolds number turbulent datasets are essential for ML models to learn the complex, multi-scale physics characteristic of real-world flows, enabling generalisation beyond the simplified, low-Reynolds number regimes often represented in existing datasets. This paper introduces WAKESET, a novel, large-scale CFD dataset of highly turbulent flows, designed to address this critical gap. The dataset captures the complex hydrodynamic interactions during the underwater recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle by a larger extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle. It comprises 1,091 high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, augmented to 4,364 instances, covering a wide operational envelope of speeds (up to Reynolds numbers of 1.09 x 10^8) and turning angles. This work details the motivation for this new dataset by reviewing existing resources, outlines the hydrodynamic modelling and validation underpinning its creation, and describes its structure. The dataset's focus on a practical engineering problem, its scale, and its high turbulence characteristics make it a valuable resource for developing and benchmarking ML models for flow field prediction, surrogate modelling, and autonomous navigation in complex underwater environments."

Despite the remarkable progress of generative AI, existing models remain largely confined to pixel-level instruction alignment and surface-level appearance preservation, failing to capture the underlying abstract logic necessary for genuine metaphorical generation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of Visual Metaphor Transfer (VMT), which challenges models to autonomously decouple the \"creative essence\" from a reference image and re-materialize that abstract logic onto a user-specified target subject. We propose a cognitive-inspired, multi-agent framework that operationalizes Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) through a novel Schema Grammar (\"G\"). This structured representation decouples relational invariants from specific visual entities, providing a rigorous foundation for cross-domain logic re-instantiation. Our pipeline executes VMT through a collaborative system of specialized agents: a perception agent that distills the reference into a schema, a transfer agent that maintains generic space invariance to discover apt carriers, a generation agent for high-fidelity synthesis and a hierarchical diagnostic agent that mimics a professional critic, performing closed-loop backtracking to identify and rectify errors across abstract logic, component selection, and prompt encoding. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in metaphor consistency, analogy appropriateness, and visual creativity, paving the way for automated high-impact creative applications in advertising and media.

This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for the explainability of generative models, extending the Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations (SMILE) method to generative settings. gSMILE employs controlled perturbations of textual input, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted surrogate modelling to quantify and visualise how specific components of a prompt or instruction influence model outputs. Applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), gSMILE provides fine-grained token-level attribution and generates intuitive heatmaps that highlight influential tokens and reasoning pathways. In instruction-based image editing models, the exact text-perturbation mechanism is employed, allowing for the analysis of how modifications to an editing instruction impact the resulting image. Combined with a scenario-based evaluation strategy grounded in the Operational Design Domain (ODD) framework, gSMILE allows systematic assessment of model behaviour across diverse semantic and environmental conditions. To evaluate explanation quality, we define rigorous attribution metrics, including stability, fidelity, accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness, and apply them across multiple generative architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned attributions and generalises effectively across state-of-the-art generative models. These findings highlight the potential of gSMILE to advance transparent, reliable, and responsible deployment of generative AI technologies."

Although deep neural networks provide flexible nonparametric estimators, unconstrained empirical risk minimization often leads to unstable solutions and poor generalization. In this work, image segmentation is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem that integrates physically motivated priors into deep learning models through variational regularization. The proposed framework minimizes a composite objective function consisting of a data fidelity term and penalty terms derived from reaction-diffusion equations and phase-field interface energies, all implemented as differentiable residual losses. Experiments are conducted on the LIVECell dataset, a high-quality, manually annotated collection of phase-contrast microscopy images. Training is performed on two cell types, while evaluation is carried out on a distinct, unseen cell type to assess generalization. A UNet architecture is used as the unconstrained baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy and boundary fidelity compared to unconstrained deep learning baselines. Moreover, the PDE-regularized models exhibit enhanced stability and improved generalization in low-sample regimes, highlighting the advantages of incorporating structured priors. The proposed approach illustrates how PDE-constrained optimization can strengthen data-driven learning frameworks, providing a principled bridge between variational methods, statistical learning, and scientific machine learning."

Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability."

Accurate detection and segmentation of CAR-T/NK IS structures using artificial neural networks (ANNs) can greatly increase the speed and reliability of IS quantification. However, a persistent challenge is the limited size of annotated microscopy datasets, which restricts the ability of ANNs to generalize. To address this challenge, we integrate two complementary data-augmentation frameworks. First, we employ Instance Aware Automatic Augmentation (IAAA), an automated, instance-preserving augmentation method that generates synthetic CAR-T/NK IS images and corresponding segmentation masks by applying optimized augmentation policies to original IS data. IAAA supports multiple imaging modalities (e.g., fluorescence and brightfield) and can be applied directly to CAR-T/NK IS images derived from patient samples. In parallel, we introduce a Semantic-Aware AI Augmentation (SAAA) pipeline that combines a diffusion-based mask generator with a Pix2Pix conditional image synthesizer. This second method enables the creation of diverse, anatomically realistic segmentation masks and produces high-fidelity CAR-T/NK IS images aligned with those masks, further expanding the training corpus beyond what IAAA alone can provide. Together, these augmentation strategies generate synthetic images whose visual and structural properties closely match real IS data, significantly improving CAR-T/NK IS detection and segmentation performance. By enhancing the robustness and accuracy of IS quantification, this work supports the development of more reliable imaging-based biomarkers for predicting patient response to CAR-T/NK immunotherapy."

By reconstructing an estimate of the clean sample at every step of the generative trajectory, DIAMOND actively steers the generation process away from latent states that lead to artifacts. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to standard Diffusion Models, demonstrating that DIAMOND provides a robust, zero-shot path to high-fidelity, artifact-free image synthesis without the need for additional training or weight modifications in modern generative architectures.

Existing MFBO methods primarily capture associational dependencies between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, rather than causal mechanisms, and can perform poorly when lower-fidelity proxies are poorly aligned with the target fidelity. We propose RESCUE (REducing Sampling cost with Causal Understanding and Estimation), a multi-objective MFBO method that incorporates causal calculus to systematically address this challenge. RESCUE learns a structural causal model capturing causal relationships between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, and uses it to construct a probabilistic multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate that encodes intervention effects. Exploiting the causal structure, we introduce a causal hypervolume knowledge-gradient acquisition strategy to select input-fidelity pairs that balance expected multi-objective improvement and cost.

        "abstract": "While dynamic Gaussian Splatting has driven significant advances in free-viewpoint video, maintaining its rendering quality with a small memory footprint for efficient streaming transmission still presents an ongoing challenge. Existing streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression methods typically leverage a latent representation to drive the neural network for predicting Gaussian residuals between frames. Their core latent representations can be categorized into structured grid-based and unstructured point-based paradigms. However, the former incurs significant parameter redundancy by inevitably modeling unoccupied space, while the latter suffers from limited compactness as it fails to exploit local correlations. To relieve these limitations, we propose HPC, a novel streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression framework. It employs a hierarchical point-based latent representation that operates on a per-Gaussian basis to avoid parameter redundancy in unoccupied space. Guided by a tailored aggregation scheme, these latent points achieve high compactness with low spatial redundancy. To improve compression efficiency, we further undertake the first investigation to compress neural networks for streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting through mining and exploiting the inter-frame correlation of parameters. Combined with latent compression, this forms a fully end-to-end compression framework. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HPC substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It achieves a storage reduction of 67% against its baseline while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity."

Our prior work has shown the feasibility of reconstructing 3D brain volumes from 2D dissection photographs. However these outputs sometimes exhibit coarse, overly smooth reconstructions of structures, especially under high anisotropy (i.e., reconstructions from thick slabs). Here, we introduce a computationally efficient super-resolution step that imputes slices to generate anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs. By training on domain-randomized synthetic data, we ensure that our method generalizes across dissection protocols and remains robust to large slab thicknesses. The imputed volumes yield improved automated segmentations, achieving higher Dice scores, particularly in cortical and white matter regions. Validation on surface reconstruction and atlas registration tasks demonstrates more accurate cortical surfaces and MRI registration. By enhancing the resolution and anatomical fidelity of photograph-based reconstructions, our approach strengthens the bridge between neuropathology and neuroimaging.

Specifically, our approach employs the 3D face predictor to reconstruct the 3D-aware facial priors encompassing the reference ID, target expressions, and poses. To capture fine-grained face details, we design ID-Encoder that fuses local and global facial features. Subsequently, we devise ID-Ctrl using the 3D face to guide the alignment of ID features. We further introduce ID-Injector to enhance ID fidelity and facial controllability. Finally, training on our collected ID-centric dataset improves face similarity and text-to-image (T2I) alignment.

However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by the ``Memory Wall,'' restricting practical deployments to low resolutions (e.g., $64 \\times 64$). This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \\textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \\times 480$ resolution -- a $50\\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms. This work demonstrates that resolving the ``Memory Wall'' via architectural co-design is not merely an optimization, but a prerequisite for enabling high-fidelity, responsive neural gameplay."

The challenges lie in sampling the distribution of high-quality images and adjusting the outputs on the basis of the degradation. This paper presents a novel approach, Bridging Degradation discrimination and Generation (BDG), which aims to address these challenges concurrently. First, we propose the Multi-Angle and multi-Scale Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (MAS-GLCM) and demonstrate its effectiveness in performing fine-grained discrimination of degradation types and levels. Subsequently, we divide the diffusion training process into three distinct stages: generation, bridging, and restoration. The objective is to preserve the diffusion model's capability of restoring rich textures while simultaneously integrating the discriminative information from the MAS-GLCM into the restoration process. This enhances its proficiency in addressing multi-task and multi-degraded scenarios. Without changing the architecture, BDG achieves significant performance gains in all-in-one restoration and real-world super-resolution tasks, primarily evidenced by substantial improvements in fidelity without compromising perceptual quality.

A two-stage decoupled strategy first instruction-tunes the MLLM, then aligns DiT with it using curated interleaved image-text sequences.

We introduce ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a streamlined motion-imitation framework that trains policies via reinforcement learning from diverse sources -- high-fidelity motion capture, noisy monocular video, and non-physics-constrained animation -- and deploys them to hardware zero-shot. ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1. Furthermore, it extends across morphologies to the Spot quadruped, enabling acrobatics, such as a continuous backflip, through animation. Together, these results demonstrate robust zero-shot deployment across heterogeneous data sources and embodiments, establishing ZEST as a scalable interface between biological movements and their robotic counterparts."

We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples."

In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI."

To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels.

Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

This paper proposes a scalable and reliable Bayesian surrogate model, termed the Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN). The B-INN combines high-order interpolation theory with tensor decomposition and alternating direction algorithm to enable effective dimensionality reduction without compromising predictive accuracy. We theoretically show that the function space of a B-INN is a subset of that of Gaussian processes, while its Bayesian inference exhibits linear complexity, $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, with respect to the number of training samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that B-INNs can be from 20 times to 10,000 times faster with a robust uncertainty estimation compared to Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes. These capabilities make B-INN a practical foundation for uncertainty-driven active learning in large-scale industrial simulations, where computational efficiency and robust uncertainty calibration are paramount."

By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly elevated the visual fidelity of Virtual Try-On (VTON) systems, yet reliable evaluation remains a persistent bottleneck. Traditional metrics struggle to quantify fine-grained texture details and semantic consistency, while existing datasets fail to meet commercial standards in scale and diversity. We present OpenVTON-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 100K high-resolution image pairs (up to $1536 \\times 1536$). The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts. Experimental results show strong agreement with human judgments (Kendall's $\u03c4$ of 0.833 vs. 0.611 for SSIM), establishing a robust benchmark for VTON evaluation."

Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-\u00c5 all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\\% under loose and 33.4\\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments. Collectively, these results establish GeoOpt-Net as a scalable, physically consistent geometry refinement framework that enables efficient acceleration of DFT-based quantum-chemical workflows."

To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games."

        "abstract": "Current quantization methods for LLMs predominantly rely on block-wise structures to maintain efficiency, often at the cost of representational flexibility. In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs."

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.\n  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.\n  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.\n  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/techmonsterwang/LINA."

Specifically, we design a Temporal Adapter to deeply entangle watermarks with acoustic attributes, synergizing with a Coarse-to-Fine Gated Extractor to resist advanced attacks. Furthermore, we develop an Accuracy-Guided Optimization Curriculum that dynamically orchestrates gradient flow to resolve the optimization conflict between fidelity and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VocBulwark achieves high-capacity and high-fidelity watermarking, offering robust defense against complex practical scenarios, with resilience to Codec regenerations and variable-length manipulations."

While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning."

In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens. This design simplifies autoregressive dependencies and mitigates the train-test discrepancy in multi-scale conditioning scenario within the VAR paradigm. DreamVAR further incorporates reinforcement learning to jointly enhance semantic alignment and subject consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamVAR achieves superior appearance preservation compared to leading diffusion-based methods."

        "abstract": "Recent progress in generative modeling has enabled high-quality visual synthesis with diffusion-based frameworks, supporting controllable sampling and large-scale training. Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency."

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably."

To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs.

        "abstract": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions."

In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines."

Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure."

However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing."

We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation."

        "abstract": "Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance."

Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm."

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \\textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging.

Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations.

Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing."

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance."

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train HER models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints."

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings demonstrate that adversarial vulnerability is not an artifact of end-to-end differentiability but a fundamental property of image classification systems, with implications for security-critical deployments across computational paradigms."

To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process.

We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs."

        "abstract": "Quantum state tomography (QST) is essential for validating quantum devices but suffers from exponential scaling in system size. Neural-network quantum states, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), can efficiently parameterize individual many-body quantum states and have been successfully used for QST. However, existing approaches are point-wise and require retraining at every parameter value in a phase diagram. We introduce a parametric QST framework based on a hypernetwork that conditions an RBM on Hamiltonian control parameters, enabling a single model to represent an entire family of quantum ground states. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model, our HyperRBM achieves high-fidelity reconstructions from local Pauli measurements on 1D and 2D lattices across both phases and through the critical region. Crucially, the model accurately reproduces the fidelity susceptibility and identifies the quantum phase transition without prior knowledge of the critical point. These results demonstrate that hypernetwork-modulated neural quantum states provide an efficient and scalable route to tomographic reconstruction across full phase diagrams."

In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components. In particular, in the decoder, the relationship between the input and output of a Transformer is approximately linear."

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization."

For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner."

Although these applications benefit from detailed visual data, the resulting data volumes impose significant challenges on satellite communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth, power, and dynamic link conditions. To address these limitations, this paper investigates Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) as an effective source-channel paradigm for the transmission of EO imagery. We focus on two complementary aspects of semantic loss in DJSCC-based systems. First, a reconstruction-centric framework is evaluated by analyzing the semantic degradation of reconstructed images under varying compression ratios and channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Second, a task-oriented framework is developed by integrating DJSCC with lightweight, application-specific models (e.g., EfficientViT), with performance measured using downstream task accuracy rather than pixel-level fidelity. Based on extensive empirical analysis, we propose a unified semantic loss framework that captures both reconstruction-centric and task-oriented performance within a single model. This framework characterizes the implicit relationship between JSCC compression, channel SNR, and semantic quality, offering actionable insights for the design of robust and efficient EO imagery transmission under resource-constrained satellite links."

        "abstract": "High-quality Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging usually needs extensive signal averaging to reduce noise and drift which severely limits clinical speed. Deep learning can accelerate imaging by reconstructing spectra from rapid, single-scan inputs. However, separating noise and baseline drift simultaneously without ground truth is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard black-box architectures often rely on statistical approximations that introduce spectral hallucinations or fail to generalize to unstable atmospheric conditions. To solve these issues we propose a physics-informed cascade Unet that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new, deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture forces the network to separate random noise from chemical signals using an embedded SNIP layer to enforce spectroscopic constraints instead of learning statistical approximations. We benchmarked this approach against a standard single Unet and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow. We used a dataset of human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu). The cascade model outperformed all other methods, achieving a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, surpassing both the single Unet (40.2%) and the traditional workflow (33.7%). Peak-aware metrics show that the cascade architecture eliminates spectral hallucinations found in standard deep learning. It also preserves peak intensity with much higher fidelity than traditional smoothing. These results show that the cascade Unet is a robust solution for diagnostic-grade FTIR imaging. It enables imaging speeds 32 times faster than current methods."

Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric."

In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl.

To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually."

REVQ combines a shared quantizer with dynamically routed expert quantizers that are activated according to the input audio, decoupling bitrate from codebook capacity and improving compression efficiency. This design ensures full training and utilization of each quantizer.

In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality.

(2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models."

However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios."

Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate."

While extensively studied in face recognition, this vulnerability remains largely unexplored in voice biometrics. Prior work on voice morphing is computationally expensive, non-scalable, and limited to acoustically similar identity pairs, constraining practical deployment. Moreover, existing sound-morphing methods target audio textures, music, or environmental sounds and are not transferable to voice identity manipulation. We propose VoxMorph, a zero-shot framework that produces high-fidelity voice morphs from as little as five seconds of audio per subject without model retraining. Our method disentangles vocal traits into prosody and timbre embeddings, enabling fine-grained interpolation of speaking style and identity. These embeddings are fused via Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) and synthesized using an autoregressive language model coupled with a Conditional Flow Matching network. VoxMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering a 2.6x gain in audio quality, a 73% reduction in intelligibility errors, and a 67.8% morphing attack success rate on automated speaker verification systems under strict security thresholds. This work establishes a practical and scalable paradigm for voice morphing with significant implications for biometric security.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks."

Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction."

While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval."

        "abstract": "Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline."

        "abstract": "Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration."

To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining."

The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition."

(2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization.

To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings."

The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement.

Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement.

We argue this compromise is fundamentally at odds with the requirements of general intelligence.

As a solution, we present the \\textbf{Halo Architecture}, which transitions the computational foundation from approximate reals ($\\mathbb{R}$) to exact rationals ($\\mathbb{Q}$). Halo is realized through a custom \\textbf{Exact Inference Unit (EIU)}, whose design -- featuring asynchronous MIMD reduction and dual-modular redundancy -- resolves the performance and reliability bottlenecks of exact computation at scale.\n  In rigorous simulations, 600B-parameter BF16 models fail in chaotic systems within steps, while Halo sustains \\textbf{perfect numerical fidelity} indefinitely.

Traditional surrogate-assisted optimization methods using deep learning can accelerate the design process but do not usually incorporate uncertainty quantification, leading to poorer optimization performance due to erroneous predictions in data-sparse regions. Here, we introduce and validate a fundamentally different paradigm of Physics-Informed Uncertainty, where the degree to which a model's prediction violates fundamental physical laws serves as a computationally-cheap and effective proxy for predictive uncertainty. By integrating physics-informed uncertainty into a multi-fidelity uncertainty-aware optimization workflow to design complex frequency-selective surfaces within the 20 - 30 GHz range, we increase the success rate of finding performant solutions from less than 10% to over 50%, while simultaneously reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude compared to the sole use of a high-fidelity solver. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine-learning-driven inverse design for high-dimensional problems, and establish physics-informed uncertainty as a viable alternative to quantifying uncertainty in surrogate models for physical systems, thereby setting the stage for autonomous scientific discovery systems that can efficiently and robustly explore and evaluate candidate designs."

We find that this shortcut forces the sampler to traverse off-manifold, high-cost regions, inflating the correction burden and inviting semantic drift. We refer to this shared failure mode as fixed-schedule domain transfer. In this paper, we embed domain-shift dynamics directly into the generative process. Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency. Empirically, across translation tasks in medical imaging, remote sensing, and electroluminescence semantic mapping, our framework improves structural fidelity and semantic consistency while converging in fewer denoising steps."

However, the transmission speed of the satellite downlink has become a major bottleneck in certain applications, such as disaster monitoring and emergency mapping, which demand a fast response ability. We propose an efficient AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing paradigm for hyperspectral image classification, facilitating the satellites to attain autonomous decision-making. To accommodate the resource constraints of satellite platforms, the proposed method adopts a lightweight, non-deep learning framework integrated with a few-shot learning strategy. Moreover, onboard processing on satellites could be faced with sensor failure and scan pattern errors, which result in degraded image quality with bad/misaligned pixels and mixed noise. To address these challenges, we develop a novel two-stage pixel-wise label propagation scheme that utilizes only intrinsic spectral features at the single pixel level without the necessity to consider spatial structural information as requested by deep neural networks. In the first stage, initial pixel labels are obtained by propagating selected anchor labels through the constructed anchor-pixel affinity matrix. Subsequently, a top-k pruned sparse graph is generated by directly computing pixel-level similarities. In the second stage, a closed-form solution derived from the sparse graph is employed to replace iterative computations. Furthermore, we developed a rank constraint-based graph clustering algorithm to determine the anchor labels."

Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches."

GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior."

To solve the above problems, we propose a novel framework MindCine to achieve high-fidelity video reconstructions on limited data. We employ a multimodal joint learning strategy to incorporate beyond-text modalities in the training stage and leverage a pre-trained large EEG model to relieve the data scarcity issue for decoding semantic information, while a Seq2Seq model with causal attention is specifically designed for decoding perceptual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, the results underscore the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different modalities and demonstrate that leveraging a large-scale EEG model can further enhance reconstruction performance by alleviating the challenges associated with limited data."

Our core contribution is to formulate this as a tractable black-box optimization problem. We parameterize the hand's motion using a low-dimensional, spline-based representation built on sparse temporal keyframes. This allows us to use a powerful gradient-free optimizer, CMA-ES, to treat the high-fidelity physics engine as a black-box objective function. Our method finds motions that simultaneously maximize physical success (e.g., stable grasp and lift) while minimizing deviation from the original human demonstration.\n  Compared to MANIPTRANS-recent transfer pipelines, our approach achieves lower hand and object pose errors during replay and more accurately recovers hand-object physical interactions. Our approach provides a general and scalable method for converting visual demonstrations into physically valid trajectories, enabling the generation of high-fidelity data crucial for robust policy learning."

We present MoReBRAC, a model-based framework that addresses this limitation through Uncertainty-Aware latent synthesis. Instead of relying solely on the fixed data, MoReBRAC utilizes a dual-recurrent world model to synthesize high-fidelity transitions that augment the training manifold. To ensure the reliability of this synthetic data, we implement a hierarchical uncertainty pipeline integrating Variational Autoencoder (VAE) manifold detection, model sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This multi-layered filtering process guarantees that only transitions residing within high-confidence regions of the learned dynamics are utilized. Our results on D4RL Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks reveal significant performance gains, particularly in ``random'' and ``suboptimal'' data regimes.

Previous 3D reconstruction kernels, such as Gaussians, Exponential functions, and Student's t distributions, serve as the low pass filters to isolate the baseband spectrum. However, their unideal low-pass property results in the overlap of high-frequency components with low-frequency components in the discrete-time signal's spectrum. To this end, we introduce Jinc kernel with an instantaneous drop to zero magnitude exactly at the cutoff frequency, which is corresponding to the ideal low pass filters. As Jinc kernel suffers from low decay speed in the spatial domain, we further propose modulated kernels to strick an effective balance, and achieves superior rendering performance by reconciling spatial efficiency and frequency-domain fidelity. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our Jinc and modulated kernels."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in fMRI-based image reconstruction have achieved remarkable photo-realistic fidelity. Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas."

        "abstract": "Boundary Representation (B-Rep) is the widely adopted standard\n  in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and manufacturing. However, generative modeling of B-Reps remains a formidable challenge due to their inherent heterogeneity as geometric cell complexes, which entangles topology with geometry across cells of varying orders (i.e., $k$-cells such as vertices, edges, faces). Previous methods typically rely on cascaded sequences to handle this hierarchy, which fails to fully exploit the geometric relationships between cells, such as adjacency and sharing, limiting context awareness and error recovery. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm that reformulates B-Reps into sets of compositional $k$-cell particles. Our approach encodes each topological entity as a composition of particles, where adjacent cells share identical latents at their interfaces, thereby promoting geometric coupling along shared boundaries. By decoupling the rigid hierarchy, our representation unifies vertices, edges, and faces, enabling the joint generation of topology and geometry with global context awareness.\n  We synthesize these particle sets using a multi-modal flow matching framework to handle unconditional generation as well as precise conditional tasks, such as 3D reconstruction from single-view or point cloud. Furthermore, the explicit and localized nature of our representation naturally extends to downstream tasks like local in-painting and enables the direct synthesis of non-manifold structures (e.g., wireframes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-fidelity CAD models with superior validity and editability compared to state-of-the-art methods."

However, existing benchmarks predominantly target consumer-oriented scenarios (e.g., e-commerce and travel booking), failing to capture the complexity and rigor of professional enterprise workflows. Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents. We release EntWorld as a rigorous testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of the next generation of enterprise-ready digital agents."

We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66).

Here we introduce GenAI-Net, a generative AI framework that automates CRN design by coupling an agent that proposes reactions to simulation-based evaluation defined by a user-specified objective. GenAI-Net efficiently produces novel, topologically diverse solutions across multiple design tasks, including dose responses, complex logic gates, classifiers, oscillators, and robust perfect adaptation in deterministic and stochastic settings (including noise reduction). By turning specifications into families of circuit candidates and reusable motifs, GenAI-Net provides a general route to programmable biomolecular circuit design and accelerates the translation from desired function to implementable mechanisms."

Recent work augments LLMs with external tools to enable agentic reasoning, achieving high utility and efficiency in a plug-and-play manner. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of such methods to malicious manipulation of the tool-calling process remain largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a tool-specific attack surface and propose Sponge Tool Attack (STA), which disrupts agentic reasoning solely by rewriting the input prompt under a strict query-only access assumption. Without any modification on the underlying model or the external tools, STA converts originally concise and efficient reasoning trajectories into unnecessarily verbose and convoluted ones before arriving at the final answer. This results in substantial computational overhead while remaining stealthy by preserving the original task semantics and user intent. To achieve this, we design STA as an iterative, multi-agent collaborative framework with explicit rewritten policy control, and generates benign-looking prompt rewrites from the original one with high semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across 6 models (including both open-source models and closed-source APIs), 12 tools, 4 agentic frameworks, and 13 datasets spanning 5 domains validate the effectiveness of STA."

Recent works have gravitated towards processing in the spectral domain; however, spectrogram-domains typically struggle with phase modeling which is naturally complex-valued. Most frequency-domain neural codecs either disregard phase information or encode it as two separate real-valued channels, limiting spatial fidelity. This entails the need to introduce adversarial discriminators at the expense of convergence speed and training stability to compensate for the inadequate representation power of the audio signal. In this work we introduce an end-to-end complex-valued RVQ-VAE audio codec that preserves magnitude-phase coupling across the entire analysis-quantization-synthesis pipeline and removes adversarial discriminators and diffusion post-filters. Without GANs or diffusion we match or surpass much longer-trained baselines in-domain and reach SOTA out-of-domain performance. Compared to standard baselines that train for hundreds of thousands of steps, our model reducing training budget by an order of magnitude is markedly more compute-efficient while preserving high perceptual quality."

We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow."

        "abstract": "The precise segmentation of geological linear features, spanning from planetary lineaments to terrestrial fractures, demands capturing long-range dependencies across complex anisotropic topologies. Although State Space Models (SSMs) offer near-linear computational complexity, their dependence on rigid, axis-aligned scanning trajectories induces a fundamental topological mismatch with curvilinear targets, resulting in fragmented context and feature erosion. To bridge this gap, we propose Fluxamba, a lightweight architecture that introduces a topology-aware feature rectification framework. Central to our design is the Structural Flux Block (SFB), which orchestrates an anisotropic information flux by integrating an Anisotropic Structural Gate (ASG) with a Prior-Modulated Flow (PMF). This mechanism decouples feature orientation from spatial location, dynamically gating context aggregation along the target's intrinsic geometry rather than rigid paths. Furthermore, to mitigate serialization-induced noise in low-contrast environments, we incorporate a Hierarchical Spatial Regulator (HSR) for multi-scale semantic alignment and a High-Fidelity Focus Unit (HFFU) to explicitly maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of faint features. Extensive experiments on diverse geological benchmarks (LROC-Lineament, LineaMapper, and GeoCrack) demonstrate that Fluxamba establishes a new state-of-the-art. Notably, on the challenging LROC-Lineament dataset, it achieves an F1-score of 89.22% and mIoU of 89.87%. Achieving a real-time inference speed of over 24 FPS with only 3.4M parameters and 6.3G FLOPs, Fluxamba reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to heavy-weight baselines, thereby establishing a new Pareto frontier between segmentation fidelity and onboard deployment feasibility."

Additionally, current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on the outcomes of downstream tasks (e.g., auto-grading), which often probe only a subset of the recognized content, thereby failing to capture the MLLMs' understanding of complex handwritten logic as a whole. To bridge this gap, we release EDU-CIRCUIT-HW, a dataset consisting of 1,300+ authentic student handwritten solutions from a university-level STEM course. Utilizing the expert-verified verbatim transcriptions and grading reports of student solutions, we simultaneously evaluate various MLLMs' upstream recognition fidelity and downstream auto-grading performance. Our evaluation uncovers an astonishing scale of latent failures within MLLM-recognized student handwritten content, highlighting the models' insufficient reliability for auto-grading and other understanding-oriented applications in high-stakes educational settings. In solution, we present a case study demonstrating that leveraging identified error patterns to preemptively detect and rectify recognition errors, with only minimal human intervention (approximately 4% of the total solutions), can significantly enhance the robustness of the deployed AI-enabled grading system on unseen student solutions."

SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination.

To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios."

However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation."

In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation."

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods."

However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling."

        "abstract": "Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \\$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact."

However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency."

Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360\u00b0 scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation."

VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival.

In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models."

To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks.

However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results."

As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement."

However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity."

However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies.

Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework.

The inherent challenges include ASMR's subtle, often unvoiced characteristics and the demand for zero-shot speaker adaptation. In this paper, we introduce DeepASMR, the first framework designed for zero-shot ASMR generation. We demonstrate that a single short snippet of a speaker's ordinary, read-style speech is sufficient to synthesize high-fidelity ASMR in their voice, eliminating the need for whispered training data from the target speaker. Methodologically, we first identify that discrete speech tokens provide a soft factorization of ASMR style from speaker timbre. Leveraging this insight, we propose a two-stage pipeline incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) for content-style encoding and a flow-matching acoustic decoder for timbre reconstruction. Furthermore, we contribute DeepASMR-DB, a comprehensive 670-hour English-Chinese multi-speaker ASMR speech corpus, and introduce a novel evaluation protocol integrating objective metrics, human listening tests, LLM-based scoring and unvoiced speech analysis. Extensive experiments confirm that DeepASMR achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and style fidelity in ASMR generation for anyone of any voice, while maintaining competitive performance on normal speech synthesis."

        "abstract": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation. However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models."

        "author": "Zhikang Chen, and Tingting Zhu",
        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15533v1",
        "abstract": "A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15431v1",
        "abstract": "Radiance field-based rendering methods have attracted significant interest from the computer vision and computer graphics communities. They enable high-fidelity rendering with complex real-world lighting effects, but at the cost of high rendering time. 3D Gaussian Splatting solves this issue with a rasterisation-based approach for real-time rendering, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, and extended reality. However, current 3DGS implementations are difficult to integrate into traditional mesh-based rendering pipelines, which is a common use case for interactive applications and artistic exploration. To address this limitation, this software solution uses Nvidia's interprocess communication (IPC) APIs to easily integrate into implementations and allow the results to be viewed in external clients such as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and OpenGL viewers. The code is available at https://github.com/RockyXu66/splatbus."

        "abstract": "VIBETENSOR is an open-source research system software stack for deep learning, generated by LLM-powered coding agents under high-level human guidance. In this paper, \"fully generated\" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support. Finally, we discuss failure modes in generated system software, including a \"Frankenstein\" composition effect where locally correct subsystems interact to yield globally suboptimal performance."
