        "abstract": "As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics."

Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs. Our layer index inference unlocks a range of powerful downstream applications. In particular, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization while also enabling high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation from 2D images, and intuitive depth-aware editing. By reframing depth from a physical quantity to a creative abstraction, illustrator's depth prediction offers a new foundation for editable image decomposition."

        "abstract": "Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance."

        "abstract": "While Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) show great promise as embodied agents, they continue to face substantial challenges in spatial reasoning. Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the \"collision rate\" and \"warning rate\" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment."

Unlike 3D Gaussians, sparse voxels are spatially disentangled from their neighbors and have sharp boundaries, which makes them prone to local minima during optimization. Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show that our method achieves strong reconstruction accuracy while having consistently speedy convergence. The code will be made public."

        "abstract": "Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler. All code and datasets will be publicly released at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DeVeiler."

Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations."

We collected simultaneous sEMG and IMU data sampled at 1~KHz for various arm movements. A Sliding-Window-Wave-Net model, based on dilated causal convolutions, was trained to map the IMU data to the sEMG signal. The results show that the model successfully predicts the timing and general shape of muscle activations. Although peak amplitudes were often underestimated, the high temporal fidelity demonstrates the feasibility of using this method for muscle intent detection in applications such as prosthetics and rehabilitation biofeedback."

This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\\%$ to $6.3\\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations."

However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wangtong627/DiverseVAR."

        "abstract": "Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations."

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has greatly advanced data-driven channel modeling and resource optimization in wireless communication systems. However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches."

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning."

We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity."

We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain.

Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry."

Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance."

A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.\n  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation."

However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data."

To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics."

        "abstract": "Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty."

A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance."

LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%.

However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

        "abstract": "Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution."

Extensive experiments show that FlashMesh achieves up to a 2 x speedup over standard autoregressive models while also improving generation fidelity.

Existing FIA methods often produce limited reconstruction quality, making it difficult to assess the true extent of privacy leakage. To reveal the privacy risk of the leaked features, we introduce FIA-Flow, a black-box FIA framework that achieves high-fidelity image reconstruction from intermediate features. To exploit the semantic information within intermediate features, we design a Latent Feature Space Alignment Module (LFSAM) to bridge the semantic gap between the intermediate feature space and the latent space. Furthermore, to rectify distributional mismatch, we develop Deterministic Inversion Flow Matching (DIFM), which projects off-manifold features onto the target manifold with one-step inference. This decoupled design simplifies learning and enables effective training with few image-feature pairs. To quantify privacy leakage from a human perspective, we also propose two metrics based on a large vision-language model. Experiments show that FIA-Flow achieves more faithful and semantically aligned feature inversion across various models (AlexNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, DINO, and YOLO11) and layers, revealing a more severe privacy threat in Split DNNs than previously recognized."

This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains."

This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a \"flooding-pruning\" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets.

In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks."

        "abstract": "Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples."

        "abstract": "The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.\n  To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT."

        "abstract": "The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

        "abstract": "Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness."

We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN.

To explore the ecological advantages of such staged \"visual diets\", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released."

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines."

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions."

The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild."

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement.

However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board."

To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.\n  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU.

Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication."

        "abstract": "This work addresses the full-information output regulation problem for nonlinear systems, assuming the states of both the plant and the exosystem are known. In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold $\u03c0(w)$ and a feedforward input $c(w)$ that render such manifold invariant. The pair $(\u03c0(w), c(w))$ is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates $\u03c0(w)$ and $c(w)$ by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem."

The core of InterMoE is a routing mechanism that synergistically uses both high-level text semantics and low-level motion context to dispatch temporal motion features to specialized experts. This allows experts to dynamically determine the selection capacity and focus on critical temporal features, thereby preserving specific individual characteristic identities while ensuring high semantic fidelity.

His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM.

In this work, we explore whether recent diffusion-based video generation methods (a.k.a. world models), paired with structured 3D layouts, can enable a fully automated pipeline to self-correct such failure cases. We first introduce an agent to simulate the role of product manager, dubbed PM-Agent, which formulates data requirements to collect data similar to the failure cases. Then, we use a generative model that can simulate both data collection and annotation. However, existing generative models struggle to generate high-fidelity data conditioned on 3D layouts. To address this, we propose DriveSora, which can generate spatiotemporally consistent videos aligned with the 3D annotations requested by PM-Agent. We integrate these components into our self-correcting agentic system, CorrectAD. Importantly, our pipeline is an end-to-end model-agnostic and can be applied to improve any end-to-end planner. Evaluated on both nuScenes and a more challenging in-house dataset across multiple end-to-end planners, CorrectAD corrects 62.5% and 49.8% of failure cases, reducing collision rates by 39% and 27%, respectively."

We aim to surpass the compression limits of such methods by incorporating symmetry-aware techniques, specifically targeting mirror symmetries to eliminate redundant primitives. We propose a novel compression framework, SymGS, introducing learnable mirrors into the scene, thereby eliminating local and global reflective redundancies for compression. Our framework functions as a plug-and-play enhancement to state-of-the-art compression methods, (e.g. HAC) to achieve further compression. Compared to HAC, we achieve $1.66 \\times$ compression across benchmark datasets (upto $3\\times$ on large-scale scenes).

The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter).

        "abstract": "Emerging reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces. However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

        "abstract": "Medical image enhancement is clinically valuable, but existing methods require large-scale datasets to learn complex pixel-level mappings. However, the substantial training and storage costs associated with these datasets hinder their practical deployment. While dataset distillation (DD) can alleviate these burdens, existing methods mainly target high-level tasks, where multiple samples share the same label. This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data. Notably, downstream users cannot access raw patient data. Instead, only a distilled dataset containing abstract training information is shared, which excludes patient-specific details and thus preserves privacy."

Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48x speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach."

This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training."

While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.\n  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \\textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \\textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.\n  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses."

ProxyPrints acts as a transparent middleware layer between the fingerprint scanner and the matching algorithm, transforming each scanned fingerprint into a consistent, unlinkable alias. This transformation allows biometric identities to be revoked and replaced in the event of a breach, without affecting authentication accuracy. Additionally, ProxyPrints provides organizations with breach detection capabilities by enabling the identification of out-of-band spoofing attempts involving compromised aliases.\n  We evaluate ProxyPrints on standard benchmark datasets and commercial fingerprint recognition systems, demonstrating that it preserves matching performance while offering strong security and revocability.

We present Adaptive Focus Memory (AFM), a dynamic context manager that assigns each past message one of three fidelity levels -- FULL, COMPRESSED, or PLACEHOLDER -- based on semantic similarity to the current query, half-life recency weighting, and importance classification. AFM packs messages chronologically under a strict token budget, preferring high fidelity for the most relevant turns while aiming to preserve a cheap trace of the dialogue. In a safety-oriented benchmark involving a user with a severe peanut allergy planning a trip to Thailand, AFM retains the allergy across both short and medium-length conversations, matches the safety performance of naive replay, and cuts average token usage by 66% relative to a replay baseline. We release a modular Python implementation of AFM designed for OpenAI-compatible APIs and offline operation, enabling practitioners to reduce inference cost without sacrificing safety or factual continuity in the evaluated scenario."

        "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) typically encode images into a compact latent space, reducing computational cost but introducing an optimization dilemma: a higher-dimensional latent space improves reconstruction fidelity but often hampers generative performance. Recent methods attempt to address this dilemma by regularizing high-dimensional latent spaces using external vision foundation models (VFMs). However, it remains unclear how high-dimensional VAE latents affect the optimization of generative models. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to reveal that redundant high-frequency components in high-dimensional latent spaces hinder the training convergence of diffusion models and, consequently, degrade generation quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a spectral self-regularization strategy to suppress redundant high-frequency noise while simultaneously preserving reconstruction quality. The resulting Denoising-VAE, a ViT-based autoencoder that does not rely on VFMs, produces cleaner, lower-noise latents, leading to improved generative quality and faster optimization convergence. We further introduce a spectral alignment strategy to facilitate the optimization of Denoising-VAE-based generative models. Our complete method enables diffusion models to converge approximately 2$\\times$ faster than with SD-VAE, while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (rFID = 0.28, PSNR = 27.26) and competitive generation performance (gFID = 1.82) on the ImageNet 256$\\times$256 benchmark."

The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDiTFace significantly outperforms other competing methods in terms of both facial fidelity and conditional consistency."

Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS).

Standard approaches, such as text-based Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), often lack the required specificity, potentially generating misleading examples that degrade fine-grained classifier performance. To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement. Experiments on several FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGFA."

This difficulty stems from the inherent non-linear link function in these tasks, which is either non-differentiable or lacks an explicit characterization. To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations. This function is integrated into a flexible plug-and-play framework that decouples the data-fidelity term from the diffusion prior, allowing any pretrained DM to act as a denoiser within the iterative reconstruction process. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ, CelebA and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that Diff-OneBit gives high-fidelity reconstructed images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency across 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression tasks."

The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems."

In this paper, we propose RulePilot, which mimics human expertise via LLM-based agent for addressing rule-related challenges like rule creation or conversion.

RulePilot is equipped with the intermediate representation (IR), which abstracts the complexity of config rules into structured, standardized formats, allowing LLMs to focus on generation rules in a more manageable and consistent way. We present a comprehensive evaluation of RulePilot in terms of textual similarity and execution success abilities, showcasing RulePilot can generate high-fidelity rules, outperforming the baseline models by up to 107.4% in textual similarity to ground truths and achieving better detection accuracy in real-world execution tests.

Most existing methods, which rely on extending single images, face notable computational challenges in maintaining cross-view consistency and generating high-resolution outputs. To address these issues, we propose the Geometry-guided Multi-View Diffusion Model, which incorporates mechanisms for extracting multi-view geometric information and adjusting the intensity of geometric features to generate images that are both consistent across views and rich in detail. Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation. Finally, a dynamic geometry information intensity adjustment mechanism is proposed to adaptively regulate the influence of geometric data, optimizing overall quality while ensuring the naturalness of generated images.

In this paper, we present FIA-Edit, a novel inversion-free framework that achieves high-fidelity and semantically precise edits through a Frequency-Interactive Attention. Specifically, we design two key components: (1) a Frequency Representation Interaction (FRI) module that enhances cross-domain alignment by exchanging frequency components between source and target features within self-attention, and (2) a Feature Injection (FIJ) module that explicitly incorporates source-side queries, keys, values, and text embeddings into the target branch's cross-attention to preserve structure and semantics. Comprehensive and extensive experiments demonstrate that FIA-Edit supports high-fidelity editing at low computational cost (~6s per 512 * 512 image on an RTX 4090) and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse tasks in visual quality, background fidelity, and controllability. Furthermore, we are the first to extend text-guided image editing to clinical applications.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion-based video generation have produced impressive and high-fidelity short videos. To extend these successes to generate coherent long videos, most video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent frames conditioned on previous ones. There are generally two primary paradigms: chunk-based extension and stream denoising. The former directly concatenates previous clean frames as conditioning, suffering from denoising latency and error accumulation. The latter maintains the denoising sequence with monotonically increasing noise levels. In each denoising iteration, one clean frame is produced while a new pure noise is simultaneously appended, enabling live-stream sampling. However, it struggles with fragile consistency and poor motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens (ada-BOV) for autoregressive VDMs. The BOV tokens are special learnable embeddings on VDMs. They adaptively absorb denoised preceding frames via an adaptive-layer-norm-like modulation. This design preserves the global consistency while allowing for flexible conditioning in dynamic scenarios. To ensure the quality of local dynamics essential in modulating BOV tokens, we further propose a refinement strategy for stream denoising. It decouples the sampling trajectory length from the attention window size constraint, leading to improved local guidance and overall imaging quality. We also propose a disturbance-augmented training noise schedule, which balances the convergence speed with model robustness for the stream denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves compelling qualitative and quantitative results across multiple metrics."

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Knowledge-Augmented Masked Image Generation framework, named KA-MIG, which introduces explicit knowledge of token-level semantic dependencies (\\emph{i.e.}, extracted from the training data) as priors to learn richer representations for improving performance. In particular, we explore and identify three types of advantageous token knowledge graphs, including two positive and one negative graphs (\\emph{i.e.}, the co-occurrence graph, the semantic similarity graph, and the position-token incompatibility graph). Based on three prior knowledge graphs, we design a graph-aware encoder to learn token and position-aware representations. After that, a lightweight fusion mechanism is introduced to integrate these enriched representations into the existing MIG methods. Resorting to such prior knowledge, our method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture semantic dependencies, leading to improved generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves upon existing MIG for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet."

As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems."

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex."

        "abstract": "Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap."

Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications."

This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach.

DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training.

This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error."

        "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining."

Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

We analyze how diffusion-driven image edits can significantly degrade or even fully remove embedded watermarks from state-of-the-art robust watermarking systems. Both theoretical formulations and empirical experiments are provided. We prove that as a image undergoes iterative diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded payload approaches zero, causing watermark decoding to fail. We further propose a guided diffusion attack algorithm that explicitly targets and erases watermark signals during generation. We evaluate our approach on recent deep learning-based watermarking schemes and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Finally, we discuss ethical implications of such watermark removal capablities and provide design guidelines for future watermarking strategies to be more resilient in the era of generative AI."

While prior misuse studies have focused on speaker impersonation, this work explores a distinct content-centric threat: exploiting TTS systems to produce speech containing harmful content. Realizing such threats poses two core challenges: (1) LALM safety alignment frequently rejects harmful prompts, yet existing jailbreak attacks are ill-suited for TTS because these systems are designed to faithfully vocalize any input text, and (2) real-world deployment pipelines often employ input/output filters that block harmful text and audio.\n  We present HARMGEN, a suite of five attacks organized into two families that address these challenges. The first family employs semantic obfuscation techniques (Concat, Shuffle) that conceal harmful content within text. The second leverages audio-modality exploits (Read, Spell, Phoneme) that inject harmful content through auxiliary audio channels while maintaining benign textual prompts. Through evaluation across five commercial LALMs-based TTS systems and three datasets spanning two languages, we demonstrate that our attacks substantially reduce refusal rates and increase the toxicity of generated speech.\n  We further assess both reactive countermeasures deployed by audio-streaming platforms and proactive defenses implemented by TTS providers. Our analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities: deepfake detectors underperform on high-fidelity audio; reactive moderation can be circumvented by adversarial perturbations; while proactive moderation detects 57-93% of attacks. Our work highlights a previously underexplored content-centric misuse vector for TTS and underscore the need for robust cross-modal safeguards throughout training and deployment."

However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \\textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening."

A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder.

The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between imperceptibility (measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - PSNR) and robustness (measured by Normalized Correlation - NC and Bit Error Rate - BER). We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile. The DFT method offers significant robustness at the cost of visual quality.

To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff.

        "abstract": "The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution."

        "abstract": "Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to $2048^3$-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility."

Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation.

Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours). This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\\%) and reduced carbon footprint."

Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks."

        "abstract": "The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications."

We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization."

While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting."

However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS."

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) sensors have been widely employed to capture human locomotions to enable applications such as activity recognition, human pose estimation, and fall detection. Motion capture (MoCap) systems are frequently used to generate ground truth annotations for human poses when training models with data from wearable or ambient sensors, and have been shown to be effective to synthesize data in these modalities. However, the representation of older adults, an increasingly important demographic in healthcare, in existing MoCap locomotion datasets has not been thoroughly examined. This work surveyed 41 publicly available datasets, identifying eight that include older adult motions and four that contain motions performed by younger actors annotated as old style. Older adults represent a small portion of participants overall, and few datasets provide full-body motion data for this group. To assess the fidelity of old-style walking motions, quantitative metrics are introduced, defining high fidelity as the ability to capture age-related differences relative to normative walking. Using gait parameters that are age-sensitive, robust to noise, and resilient to data scarcity, we found that old-style walking motions often exhibit overly controlled patterns and fail to faithfully characterize aging. These findings highlight the need for improved representation of older adults in motion datasets and establish a method to quantitatively evaluate the quality of old-style walking motions."

However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance."

In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis and reveal that this trade-off is fundamentally governed by the utilization of the negative prompts, where Target Negative Prompts (TNP) that embed target information in the negative prompts dramatically enhancing texture realism and fidelity but inducing shape distortions. Informed by this key insight, we introduce the Target-Balanced Score Distillation (TBSD). It formulates generation as a multi-objective optimization problem and introduces an adaptive strategy that effectively resolves the aforementioned trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TBSD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding 3D assets with high-fidelity textures and geometrically accurate shape."

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions."

However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene."

        "abstract": "Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines."

Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

        "abstract": "Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science."

        "abstract": "The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models."

        "abstract": "Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions."

        "abstract": "Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance."

Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec. It then enhances fidelity through pitch and volume modeling, preserving critical acoustic information typically lost in separate modeling approaches, and progressively refines outputs via differentiable signal processing and diffusion techniques. Evaluations confirm HQ-SVC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot SVC methods in conversion quality and efficiency. Beyond voice conversion, HQ-SVC achieves superior voice naturalness compared to specialized audio super-resolution methods while natively supporting voice super-resolution tasks."

With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks."

Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems."

However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods."

The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on large-scale benchmarks. An SNN trained on the generated I2E-ImageNet dataset achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.50%. Critically, this work establishes a powerful sim-to-real paradigm where pre-training on synthetic I2E data and fine-tuning on the real-world CIFAR10-DVS dataset yields an unprecedented accuracy of 92.5%. This result validates that synthetic event data can serve as a high-fidelity proxy for real sensor data, bridging a long-standing gap in neuromorphic engineering. By providing a scalable solution to the data problem, I2E offers a foundational toolkit for developing high-performance neuromorphic systems.

While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach."

        "abstract": "Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework.

Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.\n  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models."

The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views.

This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space. We evaluated the framework using four key NVM metrics: set voltage, reset voltage, hysteresis loop area, and low resistance state (LRS) slope. Benchmarking against RRAM device characteristics derived from previously reported Stanford model fits, other analytical models, and experimental data shows that the framework achieves low error across diverse device characteristics, offering a fast, reliable, and robust solution for RRAM modeling."

Existing applications of large language models (LLMs) often reduce complex regulatory assessments to binary decisions, lacking the necessary structure for robust legal scrutiny. We argue that compliance verification is fundamentally a rule-matching problem: it requires evaluating whether textual statements adhere to well-defined regulatory rules. To this end, we propose a novel framework that harnesses AI for rule-level compliance verification while preserving expert oversight. At its core is the Compliance Alignment Judge (CA-Judge), which evaluates model-generated justifications based on their fidelity to statutory requirements. Using this feedback, we train the Compliance Alignment LLM (CALLM), a model that produces rule-consistent, human-verifiable outputs. CALLM improves predictive performance and generates outputs that are both transparent and legally grounded, offering a more verifiable and actionable solution for real-world compliance analysis."

The flow field exhibits highly unsteady dynamics, including complex shock-boundary layer interactions, shock oscillations, and the generation of Kutta waves from the trailing edge. A high-fidelity CFD solver, employing a fifth-order spectral discontinuous Galerkin scheme in space and a strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (5,4) method in time, together with adaptive mesh refinement capability, is used to obtain the accurate flow field. Synthetic jet actuation is employed to manipulate these unsteady flow features, while the DRL agent autonomously discovers effective control strategies through direct interaction with high-fidelity compressible flow simulations. The trained controllers effectively mitigate shock-induced separation, suppress unsteady oscillations, and manipulate aerodynamic forces under transonic conditions. In the first set of experiments, aimed at both drag reduction and lift enhancement, the DRL-based control reduces the average drag coefficient by 13.78% and increases lift by 131.18%, thereby improving the lift-to-drag ratio by 121.52%, which underscores its potential for managing complex flow dynamics. In the second set, targeting drag reduction while maintaining lift, the DRL-based control achieves a 25.62% reduction in drag and a substantial 196.30% increase in lift, accompanied by markedly diminished oscillations. In this case, the lift-to-drag ratio improves by 220.26%."

How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges.

        "abstract": "Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research."

Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place.

        "abstract": "Improving the quality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), such as through super-resolution, is a crucial research area. However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity."

While hybrid SPECT/CT systems mitigate these artifacts through CT-derived attenuation maps, their high cost, limited accessibility, and added radiation exposure hinder widespread clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel CT-free solution to attenuation correction in cardiac SPECT. Specifically, we introduce Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative method that incorporates explicit physics priors via a teacher--student distillation mechanism. This approach enables attenuation artifact correction using only Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) input, while still benefiting from physics-informed supervision during training. To support this work, we also introduce CardiAC, a comprehensive dataset comprising 424 patient studies with paired NAC and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) reconstructions, alongside high-resolution CT-based attenuation maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PADM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, delivering superior reconstruction fidelity across both quantitative metrics and visual assessment."

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method."

Second, we present an \\textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization. Third, we introduce a \\textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy.

To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

Therefore, Spectral Deconvolution imaging (SDI) methods based on PSF engineering have been proposed to achieve high-fidelity compact CSI design recently. However, the composite convolution-integration operations of SDI render the normal-equation coefficient matrix scene-dependent, which hampers the efficient exploitation of imaging priors and poses challenges for accurate reconstruction. To tackle the inherent data-dependent operators in SDI, we introduce a Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Aggregation Unfolding Framework (HSFAUF). By decomposing subproblems and projecting them into the frequency domain, HSFAUF transforms nonlinear processes into linear mappings, thereby enabling efficient solutions. Furthermore, to integrate spatial-spectral priors during iterative refinement, we propose a Spatial-Frequency Aggregation Transformer (SFAT), which explicitly aggregates information across spatial and frequency domains. By integrating SFAT into HSFAUF, we develop a Transformer-based deep unfolding method, \\textbf{H}ierarchical \\textbf{S}patial-\\textbf{F}requency \\textbf{A}ggregation \\textbf{U}nfolding \\textbf{T}ransformer (HSFAUT), to solve the inverse problem of SDI.

To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes.

In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\\% with 95\\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration."

Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction.

Digitised audio samples are converted into spike trains using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, encrypted via a modulo-based mapping scheme, and embedded into the least significant bits of RGBA image channels using a dithering mechanism to minimise perceptual distortion. Implemented in Python using NEST and realised on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, SteganoSNN attains real-time operation with an embedding capacity of 8 bits per pixel. Experimental evaluations on the DIV2K 2017 dataset demonstrate image fidelity between 40.4 dB and 41.35 dB in PSNR and SSIM values consistently above 0.97, surpassing SteganoGAN in computational efficiency and robustness.

A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\u03bcs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware."

We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort.

        "abstract": "Reconstructing high-quality point clouds from images remains challenging in computer vision. Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

To achieve this, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to translate free-form texts into JSON representations containing NURBS surface parameters (\\textit{i.e}, control points, knot vectors, degrees, and rational weights) which can be directly converted into BRep format using Python. We further propose a hybrid representation that combines untrimmed NURBS with analytic primitives to handle trimmed surfaces and degenerate regions more robustly, while reducing token complexity. Additionally, we introduce partABC, a curated subset of the ABC dataset consisting of individual CAD components, annotated with detailed captions using an automated annotation pipeline.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06152v1",
        "abstract": "Real-time processing of UAV imagery is crucial for applications requiring urgent geospatial information, such as disaster response, where rapid decision-making and accurate spatial data are essential. However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration."

Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61.

        "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are inherently corrupted by speckle noise, limiting their utility in high-precision applications. While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation."

        "abstract": "Post-training quantization offers an efficient pathway to deploy super-resolution models, yet existing methods treat weight and activation quantization independently, missing their critical interplay. Through controlled experiments on SwinIR, we uncover a striking asymmetry: weight quantization primarily degrades structural similarity, while activation quantization disproportionately affects pixel-level accuracy. This stems from their distinct roles--weights encode learned restoration priors for textures and edges, whereas activations carry input-specific intensity information. Building on this insight, we propose HarmoQ, a unified framework that harmonizes quantization across components through three synergistic steps: structural residual calibration proactively adjusts weights to compensate for activation-induced detail loss, harmonized scale optimization analytically balances quantization difficulty via closed-form solutions, and adaptive boundary refinement iteratively maintains this balance during optimization. Experiments show HarmoQ achieves substantial gains under aggressive compression, outperforming prior art by 0.46 dB on Set5 at 2-bit while delivering 3.2x speedup and 4x memory reduction on A100 GPUs. This work provides the first systematic analysis of weight-activation coupling in super-resolution quantization and establishes a principled solution for efficient high-quality image restoration."

        "abstract": "Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation."

In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization."

In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions, particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new state-of-the-art.

For decades, operationalizing this step for complex, non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework, a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity, individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new and more rigorous standard for this emerging field."

They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability."

We introduce an implicit self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location, the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS) formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse regions.

        "abstract": "We present Isaac Lab, the natural successor to Isaac Gym, which extends the paradigm of GPU-native robotics simulation into the era of large-scale multi-modal learning. Isaac Lab combines high-fidelity GPU parallel physics, photorealistic rendering, and a modular, composable architecture for designing environments and training robot policies. Beyond physics and rendering, the framework integrates actuator models, multi-frequency sensor simulation, data collection pipelines, and domain randomization tools, unifying best practices for reinforcement and imitation learning at scale within a single extensible platform. We highlight its application to a diverse set of challenges, including whole-body control, cross-embodiment mobility, contact-rich and dexterous manipulation, and the integration of human demonstrations for skill acquisition. Finally, we discuss upcoming integration with the differentiable, GPU-accelerated Newton physics engine, which promises new opportunities for scalable, data-efficient, and gradient-based approaches to robot learning. We believe Isaac Lab's combination of advanced simulation capabilities, rich sensing, and data-center scale execution will help unlock the next generation of breakthroughs in robotics research."

        "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating and editing high-fidelity images from text. Yet, these models remain fundamentally generic, failing to adapt to the nuanced aesthetic preferences of individual users. In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences."

        "abstract": "Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots, objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing, demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies. Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04659v2",
        "abstract": "Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\\% of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation."

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA) datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst, which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems. RAGalyst is available on our Github."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04500v1",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood. This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making."

        "author": "Ming Liu",
        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04261v1",
        "abstract": "The widespread deployment of high-resolution visual sensing systems, coupled with the rise of foundation models, has amplified privacy risks in video-based applications. Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically guaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but challenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability, and enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a novel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the theoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method adaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity, leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared to the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by retaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space overhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and parallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and PPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and significant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack experiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing identity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time privacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring."

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04215v1",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment."
