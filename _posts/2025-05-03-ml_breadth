# ML Breath

## Training and Optimization: 
### Adaptive gradient approaches, Regularization and overfitting, loss functions
### Bayesian v/s maximum likelihood estimation,
### dealing with class imbalance, K-fold cross validation, bias, and variance 
###Evaluation metrics: 
Accuracy
Precision, Recall
Area under ROC
R-squared: R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used in regression analysis to assess the goodness of fit of a model. Essentially, it indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
Mean average precision (MAP)
Mean reciprocal rank
Equal Error rate: For biometric systems - authentication.. Binary. he Equal Error Rate is the point where the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the False Rejection Rate (FRR) are equal. In other words, it is the operating point where the system makes an equal number of errors in falsely accepting legitimate users (FAR) and falsely rejecting authorized users (FRR).
