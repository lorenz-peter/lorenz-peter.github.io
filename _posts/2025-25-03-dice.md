### **1. Expected Number of Rolls Until a Condition is Met**
**Pattern**: Problems ask for the average number of rolls needed to achieve a specific outcome (e.g., rolling a 6, getting all faces, etc.).
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Geometric Distribution**: For a single event (e.g., rolling a 6), the expected number of rolls is \( \frac{1}{p} \) (e.g., 6 rolls for a fair die).
  - **Markov Chains/Recursion**: For multi-step conditions (e.g., "until two 6's appear in a row"), set up recursive equations or use states to model the problem.
  - **Coupon Collector’s Problem**: For "collecting all faces," the expected number of rolls is \( n \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} \) (e.g., 14.7 for a 6-sided die).

**Example Problems**: 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 19, 25, 26.

---

### **2. Probability of Specific Sequences or Outcomes**
**Pattern**: Questions about the probability of sequences (e.g., non-decreasing rolls), subsets (e.g., all faces appearing), or sums (e.g., sum is prime).
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: For "at least one" or "all faces" problems (e.g., Problem 5: probability all faces appear in \( n \) rolls).
  - **Generating Functions**: For sums, use polynomials to model dice outcomes (e.g., \((x + x^2 + \dots + x^6)^n\) for \( n \) dice).
  - **Dynamic Programming/Recursion**: For sequences (e.g., non-decreasing rolls), build up probabilities step-by-step.

**Example Problems**: 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 20, 22, 28, 29, 30.

---

### **3. Non-Standard Dice Problems**
**Pattern**: Questions about biased dice, custom dice, or alternative definitions (e.g., sums, re-rolling rules).
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Linear Algebra**: For non-transitive dice (e.g., Efron’s dice), construct probability matrices.
  - **Renumbering/Transformation**: For "find dice with the same sum probabilities," use generating functions or brute-force search.
  - **Conditional Probability**: For re-rolling rules (e.g., Problem 44: sum with rerolls on 6s).

**Example Problems**: 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54.

---

### **4. Sum-Related Problems**
**Pattern**: Focus on sums of dice (e.g., distribution, stopping rules, or hitting a target sum).
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Convolution**: For sums of multiple dice, convolve their probability distributions.
  - **Recursion**: For "sum reaching \( n \)" (e.g., Problem 36: \( E_n = 1 + \frac{1}{6} \sum_{k=1}^6 E_{n-k} \)).
  - **Markov Chains**: For sums modulo \( n \) (e.g., Problem 37: expected rolls until sum is divisible by \( n \)).

**Example Problems**: 29, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

---

### **5. Optimal Stopping Strategies**
**Pattern**: Decide when to stop rolling to maximize score or minimize loss (e.g., "stop when the current roll is higher than the expected future rolls").
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Backward Induction**: Calculate expected values from the end of the game (e.g., Problem 14: stop if roll > future expectation).
  - **Dynamic Programming**: For multi-stage decisions (e.g., Problem 72: stop before rolling a repeated face).

**Example Problems**: 14, 72, 73, 74, 77.

---

### **6. Markov Chains and State Transitions**
**Pattern**: Problems where the outcome depends on previous states (e.g., runs, consecutive differences, or memory-based conditions).
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Transition Matrices**: Model states and transitions (e.g., Problem 25: consecutive differences).
  - **Absorbing States**: For "game ends when X happens" (e.g., Problem 26: rolls until all faces are distinct).

**Example Problems**: 4, 6, 7, 25, 26, 35.

---

### **7. Asymptotic Behavior and Approximations**
**Pattern**: Questions about limits or large numbers (e.g., "probability all faces appear equally as \( n \to \infty \)").
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Stirling’s Approximation**: For factorials in large \( n \) (e.g., Problem 24: equal face counts in \( 6k \) rolls).
  - **Central Limit Theorem**: For sums of many dice, approximate with normal distributions.

**Example Problems**: 24, 36, 39.

---

### **8. Symmetry and Uniformity**
**Pattern**: Exploit symmetry to simplify calculations (e.g., identical dice, uniform distributions).
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Symmetry Arguments**: e.g., Problem 37: expected rolls until sum is divisible by \( n \) is \( n \), due to uniformity.
  - **Renumbering Faces**: For custom dice, relabel to match standard probabilities.

**Example Problems**: 37, 52, 54.

---

### **How to Apply These Patterns**
1. **Classify the Problem**: Identify which category the problem falls into (e.g., expected rolls, sum probabilities).
2. **Choose the Technique**: Use the corresponding method (e.g., recursion for expected rolls, generating functions for sums).
3. **Simplify with Symmetry**: Look for symmetries or uniform distributions to reduce complexity.
4. **Verify Edge Cases**: Check small \( n \) or trivial cases to ensure correctness.

By recognizing these patterns, you can tackle most dice problems systematically. For example:
- **Problem 9 (Coupon Collector)**: Use the harmonic series formula.
- **Problem 29 (Identical Sum Probabilities)**: Use generating functions to compare coefficients.
- **Problem 72 (Optimal Stopping)**: Use backward induction to find the stopping rule.
