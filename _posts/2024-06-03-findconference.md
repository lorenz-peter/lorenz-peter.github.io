# How do you find your conference in trustworthy ML?

If you have finished doing your experiments, it is about finding the right venue.

## Via Google Ranking

- [Artificial Intelligence](https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence)
- [Computer Vision](https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computervisionpatternrecognition)
- [Computational Linguistics](https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computationallinguistics)
- [Security and Privacy](https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computersecuritycryptography)

The h-index and median are both metrics used to evaluate the impact of scholarly research publications, particularly in the field of academia.

1. **h-index**: The h-index is a numerical value that attempts to measure both the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or scholar. It's calculated based on the number of papers the researcher has published and the number of citations each paper has received. The h-index is determined by arranging the researcher's publications according to the number of citations they have received. The h-index is the highest number of publications that have at least the same number of citations. For example, if a researcher has an h-index of 20, it means they have published at least 20 papers, each of which has been cited at least 20 times.

2. **Median**: In the context of h-index, the median is typically used to represent the median number of citations received by the researcher's publications. This value provides insight into the central tendency of the citation distribution of the researcher's work. It helps to understand the typical level of impact or recognition the researcher's papers have received. If a researcher's median citation count is high, it suggests that their publications tend to receive a substantial number of citations, indicating a significant impact in their field.

Both the h-index and median are valuable tools for evaluating the impact and significance of a researcher's contributions, although they each capture slightly different aspects of the citation profile.

## Journals

One key difference between journal and conference publications is the review process. Journals typically involve a more thorough and time-consuming review process, with reviewers having more time to provide detailed feedback. As a result, the publication timeline for journals is often longer than for conferences.

## arXive

First of all, putting your paper on arxive does not tell anyone, if it is a publication. 
The paper is published after being accepted at peer-reviewed conference. 

Arxive is a platform where you can upload your paper in parallel to submitting a conference. 
You can never remove it from there. In most cases, you need to put arxive in another LaTex template.
Not every conference tolerance to use their template for a preprint.
