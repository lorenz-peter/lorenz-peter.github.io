# How do you make your own illustrations for your paper? 

This is a central question, when most experiments are done and the story of the paper is becoming clearer and clearer. 
Then the question arises how to support the story visually? 

There is the option of the [teaser image](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/44837/what-is-teaser-image), that is a visually striking and representative image that is used to grab the reader's attention and provide a quick visual summary of the paper's content. 
It is typically placed prominently, often near the title or abstract, to entice readers to learn more.
