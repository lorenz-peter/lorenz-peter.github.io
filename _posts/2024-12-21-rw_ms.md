### Description

Staying current with the latest research can be a daunting task, given the rapid increase in publications each year. I've dedicated myself to meticulously tracking these papers over the past few years and realized that sharing this curated list could benefit others.

The sole criterion for selecting papers for this list is their primary focus on model stealing or extensive use of them. 


Below, you'll find the comprehensive paper list. I've also provided [JSON file](https://github.com/lorenz-peter/lorenz-peter.github.io/blob/master/assets/json/model_stealing_papers.json) [guide](https://lorenz-peter.github.io/blog/2024/load-json/) containing the same data, including one with abstracts. If you use this data for any interesting projects, I'd love to hear about your experiences.

Recently, another website was deployed to discover research trends, [researchtrend.ai](https://researchtrend.ai/communities/AAML).

In future, I might plan to to add also papers from [eprint.iacr.org](https://eprint.iacr.org/).

## Acknowledgment

    // Create an anchor tag with the link and value
    return `<a href="${link}" target="_blank">${value}</a>`;
  }
