I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, [ranked 2nd worldwide in AI research](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/nanyang-technological-university-503366).
My current research conducts adversarial machine learning and cryptanalysis, e.g. model stealing or new adversarial attacks.

Previously, I earned my PhD with magna cum laude from Heidelberg University, Germany, where I was advised by my ex-team lead [Janis Keuper](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/hpc/staff/janis-keuper.html) and supervised by Prof. [Ullrich KÃ¶the](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/ullrich-koethe). I am an external Ph.D. student at the University of Heidelberg (2nd best-ranked German university).
My key research interest was the **analysis of adversarial examples** on DNN.
In particular, deep neural networks' **robustness** and **trustworthiness**.

I also had the opportunity to intern with Prof. Sijia Liu ([MSU](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/) & [MIT-IBM](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/sijia-liu/)) and Pin-Yu Chen ([MIT-IBM](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/home)), focusing on adversarial machine learning.
Our "Visual Prompting for Adversarial Robustness" paper achieved recognition within the top 3% at the ICASSP conference.
