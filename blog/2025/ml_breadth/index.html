Essentially, it indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). Mean average precision (MAP) Mean reciprocal rank Equal Error rate: For biometric systems - authentication.. Binary. he Equal Error Rate is the point where the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the False Rejection Rate (FRR) are equal. In other words, it is the operating point where the system makes an equal number of errors in falsely accepting legitimate users (FAR) and falsely rejecting authorized users (FRR).
