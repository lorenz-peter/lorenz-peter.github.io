id="overview">Overview</h2> <ul> <li>Class imbalance arises when one or more classes in a dataset are significantly underrepresented compared to others, often leading to biased predictions by machine learning models. Models trained on imbalanced datasets may perform well for the majority class but fail to adequately capture patterns for minority classes. Addressing class imbalance is essential to ensure fair, accurate, and generalized predictions.</li> <li>Below, we explore detailed techniques to handle class imbalance at the data, model, and metrics levels.</li> </ul> <h2 id="data-based-methods">Data-based Methods</h2> <ul> <li>Data-based methods aim to modify the dataset to balance the class distribution before training.
