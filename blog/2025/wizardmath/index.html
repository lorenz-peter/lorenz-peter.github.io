While proprietary models, such as GPT-4, have demonstrated strong performance across various natural language tasks, including mathematics, most open-source LLMs have lagged, particularly in complex, multistep quantitative reasoning tasks.</p> <p>This paper directly addresses that gap by introducing a comprehensive framework—<strong>Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF)</strong>—which boosts both performance and data efficiency for mathematical problem-solving, primarily focusing on freely available model families like Llama and Mistral. <br> The Evol-Instruct method was introduced in the WizardLM approach, and the authors extended it to the mathematical domain. They created a robust mathematical supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. The introduction of new reward models—combining an Instruction Reward Model (IRM) and Process Reward Model (PRM)—for reinforcement learning in mathematics improves performance in the experiments.</p> <p>WizardMath Mistral 7B outperforms existing open-source models. The experimental results show the effectiveness of different model sizes (number of billion parameters) and WizardMath 70B even exceeds proprietary models, those as strong proprietary models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4-early-version. <br> It should be noted that open-source models are usually (except Llama or DeepSeekMath) not necessarily pre-trained on mathematical datasets, and how proprietary models are trained is a secret or only partially disclosed. Further, in the result Table 1 (see [1]), it should be considered that WizardMath is a model trained with both SFT and reinforcement learning (RL), whereas typically other models are not fine-tuned via RL. It would be interesting to see how the other models might also benefit comparably from RL for a more insightful evaluation. Moreover, WizardMath relies on the proprietary GPT-4 model for PRM, which makes it challenging to fully agree with the authors’ characterization of WizardMath as a fair comparison to open-source models.</p> <p>While not explicitly stated in the paper, recent trends include the use of WizardMath to enhance agentic AI, enabling autonomous problem-solving and decision-making in complex environments. This aligns with industries requiring verifiable, step-by-step reasoning for high-stakes decisions, driving progress in fields like robotics and scientific research.</p> <p>In summary, WizardMath is a milestone for open-source mathematical LLMs, demonstrating that process-supervised RL with diversified, AI-evolved math data can vault open models into (and beyond) the realm previously dominated by closed, expensive alternatives.</p> <h1 id="analysis-report">Analysis Report</h1> <h2 id="1-context">1. Context</h2> <p>Large-scale language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention and become the preferred solution for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as open-domain conversations, coding, and mathematics.</p> <p>LLMs are typically pre-trained on vast amounts of internet data and then fine-tuned using specialized instruction data and techniques. This approach enables them to achieve cutting-edge zero-shot performance across multiple benchmarks.</p> <p>This trend also gradually stimulates the releases of open-source models (Mistral, Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM [2]).</p> <p>Closed-source models, like those developed by OpenAI, often perform better in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks due to their more specialized training, optimizations, and proprietary techniques [3]. They tend to have access to more tailored datasets and advanced methods for fine-tuning, which can enhance their performance in areas like multi-step mathematical and scientific reasoning [3,4].</p> <p>The authors emphasize that they excluded external Python tools (such as ToRA [5], MAmmoTH [6], or OpenMathInstruct-2 [7]) from their research. ToRA, for example, focuses not only on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning [5], but also on a system with Agentic AI, where tools are provided to enhance reasoning. In contrast, WizardMath’s contribution is centered on the reasoning process itself, rather than on the system.</p> <p>In 2024, ToRA published its results and is outperforming the WizardMath results from the arXiv version of 2023:</p> <p><em>Notably, TORA-7B reaches 44.6% on the competition-level dataset MATH, surpassing the best open-source model WizardMath-70B by 22% absolute. TORACODE-34B is also the first open-source model that achieves an accuracy exceeding 50% on MATH, which significantly outperforms GPT-4’s CoT result, and is competitive with GPT-4 solving problems with programs.</em></p> <p>There is no direct comparison of the current WizardMath publication and ToRA, which makes the impression that WizardMath won’t be able to at the moment. WizardMath explicitly writes that they only outperform GPT-4 earlier versions.</p> <h2 id="2-technical-contributions-and-innovations">2. Technical Contributions and Innovations</h2> <p>In this section, we will discuss the evol-instruct, reinforcement learning, and automated and scalable approach.</p> <p>Note: In Appendix A2 - remarks by the reviewers: <br> <em>While the empirical results are strong, some reviewers see the novelty as moderate because both the Evol-Instruct framework and PRM methodology existed previously—the paper “basically took Evol-Instruct and PRM and used them to train a model”.</em></p> <p>In Figure 1 (copied from [1]), the 3 steps of the WizardMath method are illustrated.</p> <p><img src="wizardmath/yNZ_Image_1.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></p> <p>As illustrated in Figure 1, the authors propose a novel method called Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF). This approach aims to generate diverse math instruction data through a newly introduced framework, Math Evol-Instruct, which incorporates both downward and upward evolution processes. The downward evolution generates grade school math problems, while the upward evolution tackles more challenging high school-level math. (More in Section 2.1)</p> <p>In contrast to WizardLM [2] and WizardCoder [8], which primarily focus on the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage and are prone to learning hallucinated information from the teacher model, the authors of this study introduce the innovative use of a Process-Reward Model (PRM). This model addresses the issue of false positives that can arise during the problem-solving process.</p> <p>To prevent the instruction evolution from becoming uncontrollable, the authors also introduce an Instruction Reward Model (IRM). The IRM is designed to evaluate the quality of the evolved instructions, while the PRM provides feedback on each reasoning step during the solution process. These two reward models are trained using existing research [9-12]. (More in Section 2.2)</p> <p>The training process begins by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with the evolved math data. Subsequently, GPT-4 is employed to produce a ranking order of the instructions and assess the correctness of each reasoning step. The LLMs are then optimized to incorporate this feedback into the reward models. Finally, a Step-by-Step Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [13] approach is used to train the model, WizardMath, ensuring it adapts to the evolving instructions while maintaining accuracy.</p> <h2 id="21-math-evol-instruct-diversified-synthetic-data-generation">2.1 Math Evol-Instruct: Diversified Synthetic Data Generation</h2> <ul> <li> <p>The <strong>Evol-Instruct</strong> [1, 2] methodology employs upward and downward evolution to create diverse and complex math problems.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Upward Evolution</strong> increases the complexity and constraints of existing problems, leading to more challenging questions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Downward Evolution</strong> (a novel addition) simplifies problems, creating easier variants.

Conclusion</h2> <p>WizardMath represents a significant advancement in the domain of open-source mathematical large language models (LLMs). It illustrates that process-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) combined with a diverse, AI-generated mathematical data set can propel open models to achieve, and even exceed, the performance levels traditionally seen in closed, highly costly alternatives. Its exceptional performance across core benchmarks and generalization tasks, alongside a robust and scalable training pipeline, underscores both novel scientific insights and technical expertise, thereby setting a new benchmark within the field.</p> <p>In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, the framework introduced by WizardMath not only pushes the boundaries of the current state-of-the-art but also establishes critical paradigms—such as process-based supervision, data-driven evolution, and automated reward modeling. These are poised to serve as foundational elements for future developments in language, mathematics, and broader scientific disciplines.</p> <h1 id="references">References</h1> <p>[1] WizardMath: <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=mMPMHWOdOy" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://openreview.net/forum?id=mMPMHWOdOy</a> <br> [2] WizardLM: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244</a> <br> [3] LLM Math Reasoning - Progresses and challenges: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00157" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00157</a> <br> [4] On LLMs-Driven Synthetic Data Generation, Curation, and Evaluation: A Survey <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15126" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15126</a> <br> [5] ToRA <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ToRA" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/microsoft/ToRA</a> <br> [6] MAmmoth <a href="https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/MAmmoTH" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/MAmmoTH</a> <br> [7] OpenMathInstruct-2 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01560" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01560</a> <br> [8] WizardCoder <a href="https://wizardlm.github.io/WizardCoder" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://wizardlm.github.io/WizardCoder</a> <br> [9] Let’s verify step by step <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v8L0pN6EOi" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v8L0pN6EOi</a> <br> [10] Solving math word problems with process- and outcome-based feedback <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14275" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14275</a> <br> [11] Math-Shepherd <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08935" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08935</a> <br> [12] Common 7B Language Models Already Possess Strong Math Capabilities <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04706" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04706</a> <br> [13] PPO <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_ppo.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_ppo.html</a> <br> [14] MMEVOL <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1009" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1009</a> <br> [15] Smaller Language Models Are Better Instruction Evolvers <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11231v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11231v1</a> <br> [16] Mathfusion <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16212" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16212</a></p> <h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1> <h2 id="a1-google-scholar-analysis">A1.

Reviews Summarization</h2> <p>The reviews of “WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct” highlight both substantial strengths and notable weaknesses in the work.</p> <p><strong>What reviewers found good:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strong empirical results:</strong> Reviewers consistently praised the paper for achieving impressive gains in mathematical reasoning, often exceeding those of strong proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Claude2. One reviewer noted that improvements from training on Math Evol-Instruct were “more than 10 points,” and that surpassing proprietary models is significant and attention-worthy. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thorough experiments and ablations:</strong> The paper presents exhaustive experiments over a wide range of model scales (from 100M to 70B parameters), using different base models, and compares against several math-specific baselines. The ablation studies and analyses are seen as solid evidence of the method’s advantages and scalability. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Novel methodological components:</strong> The introduction of new reward models—an Instruction Reward Model (IRM) and Process Reward Model (PRM)—for reinforcement learning in mathematics is considered a valuable innovation. Experimentally, integrating IRM with PRM is shown to robustly improve performance. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scalability and automation:</strong> The model training pipeline is largely automated using AI, including fully automated instruction evolution and reward data generation, which reviewers noted as a scalable and adaptable feature that could potentially be applied beyond math (e.g., in coding domains). \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clear practical impact:</strong> The experiments demonstrate consistent, robust improvements over open and closed alternatives, which reviewers interpret as deliverable value to the NLP and AI research community. \</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>What reviewers found bad or problematic:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Unfair baseline comparisons:</strong> Multiple reviewers criticized the fairness of comparisons in the results tables. Specifically, WizardMath is a model trained with both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), whereas many baselines have only undergone SFT. They argue that other models might also benefit comparably from RL, and comparisons should be more rigorously controlled, isolating the effects of SFT and RL. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reliance on GPT-4 labeling for PRM:</strong> Some concerns using GPT-4 for annotating process reward model (PRM) training data may not scale well to much larger datasets and could limit generalizability, though reviewers acknowledge that this enables full automation and seems effective in practice. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Presentation and clarity:</strong> The presentation was described as “messy” and at times unclear. Some technical terms and methodological concepts, like “Evol-Instruct”, were referenced before explanation, certain dataset descriptions (like grade school vs high school tasks) appeared and disappeared without clear discussion, and main tables (such as Table 1) omitted important baseline scores. There were also typos and confusing figures (e.g., Figure 1). \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Marginality of contribution:</strong> While the empirical results are strong, some reviewers see the novelty as moderate because both the Evol-Instruct framework and PRM methodology existed previously—the paper “basically took Evol-Instruct and PRM and used them to train a model”. They suggest a broader contribution could be achieved by applying the method to additional domains (such as code). \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reporting gaps:</strong> Reviewers noted that some performance information, such as base model scores for certain variants, is missing from the tables, making it difficult to appreciate the incremental gains attributable to the proposed method. \</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Other notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The authors, in their responses, elaborated on these points, providing clarification, improved explanations, and expanded ablation studies to address review concerns. They also showed openness to expanding their comparisons and clarifying their figures and methodology in future versions.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, the paper is recognized for its strong empirical performance, especially in surpassing major baselines and proprietary models, and for its scalable, automated approach using new reward models. The main criticisms center on comparative rigor, clarity/presentation, and perceived marginality in core methodological novelty.</p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/how-to-write-a-good-scientific-review/">How to write a good scientific review?</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/habits/">Habits</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/regulate-your-blood-sugarnourish-to-flourish-harnessing-glycogen-for-peak-performance-at-work/">Regulate your blood sugar! — Nourish to Flourish: Harnessing Glycogen for Peak Performance at Work</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/how-to-lead-when-you-are-not-in-charge/">How to lead when you are not in charge?</a> </li> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 930px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=determineComputedTheme(),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"lorenz-peter/lorenz-peter.github.io","data-repo-id":"","data-category":"Comments","data-category-id":"","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"1","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Peter Lorenz.
