This is my personal notebook.</p> <p>The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT. We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via <a href="https://github.com/opendilab/awesome-RLHF" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RLHF</a>). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.</p> <p>A large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.</p> <p>There is also a branch of work on attacking LLMs to extract pre-training data, private knowledge (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Carlini et al, 2020</a>) or attacking model training process via data poisoning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10149" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Carlini et al. 2023</a>). We would not cover those topics in this post.</p> <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2> <h3 id="threat-model">Threat Model</h3> <p>Adversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired. Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/threats-overview.png" alt="overview"></p> <p>Fig. 1. An overview of threats to LLM-based applications.

LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $x$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $x_{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $x$, such that $f(x) \neq f(x_{adv})$.</p> <h3 id="text-generation">Text Generation</h3> <p>Given an input $x$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $y ~ p(.|x)$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(x)$ that $y$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $y$ is unsafe or human review.</p> <h3 id="white-box-vs-black-box">White-box vs Black-box</h3> <p>White-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models. Black-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $x$ and get back sample $y$, without knowing further information about the model.</p> <h3 id="types-of-adversarial-attacks">Types of Adversarial Attacks</h3> <p>There are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Attack</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Token manipulation</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Alter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gradient based attack</td> <td>White-box</td> <td>Rely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jailbreak prompting</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Often heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Human red-teaming</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Human attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Model red-teaming</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Model attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="token-manipulation">Token Manipulation</h3> <p>Given a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.</p> <p>Ribeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers.

BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.</p> <h2 id="gradient-based-attacks">Gradient based Attacks</h2> <p>In the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.</p> <p><strong>GBDA</strong> (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13733" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Guo et al. 2021</a>) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to <em>make adversarial loss optimization differentiable</em>, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens where one token can be sampled from a categorical distribution , where and is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that is usually around and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:</p> <p>where is a vector of token probabilities for the -th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label for a classifier : . However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jang et al. 2016</a>) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution by :</p> <p>where ; the temperature controls the smoothness of the distribution.</p> <p>Gumbel distribution is used to model the <em>extreme</em> value, maximum or minimum, of a number of samples, irrespective of the sample distribution. The additional Gumbel noise brings in the stochastic decisioning that mimic the sampling process from the categorical distribution.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/gumbel.png" alt=""></p> <p>Fig. 2.

When the temperature is , it reflects the original categorical distribution. When , it becomes a uniform distribution. The expectations and samples from Gumbel softmax distribution matched well. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jang et al. 2016</a>)</p> <p>Let be the embedding representation of token . We can approximate with , a weighted average of the embedding vector corresponding to the token probabilities: . Note that when is a one-hot vector corresponding to the token , we would have . Combining the embedding representation with the Gumbel-softmax approximation, we have a differentiable objective to minimize: .</p> <p>Meanwhile, it is also easy to apply differentiable soft constraints with white-box attacks. GBDA experimented with (1) a soft fluency constraint using NLL (negative log-likelihood) and (2) BERTScore (<em>“a similarity score for evaluating text generation that captures the semantic similarity between pairwise tokens in contextualized embeddings of a transformer model.”</em>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zhang et al. 2019</a>) to measure similarity between two text inputs to ensure the perturbed version does not diverge from the original version too much. Combining all constraints, the final objective function is as follows, where are preset hyperparameters to control the strength of soft constraints:</p> <p>Gumbel-softmax tricks are hard to be extended to token deletion or addition and thus it is restricted to only token replacement operations, not deletion or addition.</p> <p><strong>HotFlip</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06751" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ebrahimi et al. 2018</a>) treats text operations as inputs in the vector space and measures the derivative of loss with regard to these vectors. Here let’s assume the input vector is a matrix of character-level one-hot encodings, and , where is the maximum number of words, is the maximum number of characters per word and is the alphabet size. Given the original input vector , we construct a new vector with the -th character of the -th word changing from , and thus we have but .</p> <p>The change in loss according to first-order Taylor expansion is:</p> <p>This objective is optimized to select the vector to minimize the adversarial loss using only one backward propagation.</p> <p>To apply multiple flips, we can run a beam search of steps of the beam width , taking forward steps. HotFlip can be extended to token deletion or addition by representing that with multiple flip operations in the form of position shifts.</p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wallace et al. (2019)</a> proposed a gradient-guided search over tokens to find short sequences (E.g. 1 token for classification and 4 tokens for generation), named <strong>Universal Adversarial Triggers</strong> (<strong>UAT</strong>), to trigger a model to produce a specific prediction. UATs are input-agnostic, meaning that these trigger tokens can be concatenated as prefix (or suffix) to any input from a dataset to take effect. Given any text input sequence from a data distribution , attackers can optimize the triggering tokens leading to a target class (, different from the ground truth) :</p> <p>Then let’s apply <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/#hotflip" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HotFlip</a> to search for the most effective token based on the change in loss approximated by first-order Taylor expansion. We would convert the triggering tokens into their one-hot embedding representations, each vector of dimension size , form and update the embedding of every trigger tokens to minimize the first-order Taylor expansion:</p> <p>where is the embedding matrix of all the tokens. is the average gradient of the task loss over a batch around the current embedding of the -th token in the adversarial triggering sequence . We can brute-force the optimal by a big dot product of size embedding of the entire vocabulary the embedding dimension . Matrix multiplication of this size is cheap and can be run in parallel.</p> <p><strong>AutoPrompt</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15980" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shin et al., 2020</a>) utilizes the same gradient-based search strategy to find the most effective prompt template for a diverse set of tasks.</p> <p>The above token search method can be augmented with beam search. When looking for the optimal token embedding , we can pick top- candidates instead of a single one, searching from left to right and score each beam by on the current data batch.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UAT.png" alt=""></p> <p>Fig. 4.

(Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wallace et al. 2019</a>)</p> <p>The design of the loss for UAT is task-specific. Classification or reading comprehension relies on cross entropy. In their experiment, conditional text generation is configured to maximize the likelihood of a language model generating similar content to a set of bad outputs given any user input:</p> <p>It is impossible to exhaust the entire space of in practice, but the paper got decent results by representing each set with a small number of examples.

(Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wallace et al. 2019</a>)</p> <p>Why UATs work is an interesting question. Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.</p> <p>One drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02392" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mehrabi et al. (2022)</a> studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations. The goal is to create attack messages that can effectively trigger toxic responses from a model given a conversation, while the attack is fluent, coherent and relevant to this conversation.</p> <p>They explored two variations of UAT:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Variation #1: <strong>UAT-LM</strong> (Universal Adversarial Trigger with Language Model Loss) adds a constraint on language model logprob on the trigger tokens, , to encourage the model to learn sensical token combination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Variation #2: <strong>UTSC</strong> (Unigram Trigger with Selection Criteria) follows a few steps to generate attack messages by (1) first generating a set of <em>unigram</em> UAT tokens, (2) and then passing these unigram triggers and conversation history to the language model to generate different attack utterances. Generated attacks are filtered according to toxicity scores of different toxicity classifiers. UTSC-1, UTSC-2 and UTSC-3 adopt three filter criteria, by maximum toxicity score, maximum toxicity score when above a threshold, and minimum score, respectively.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UTSC.png" alt=""></p> <p>Fig. 6.

High perplexity makes an attack more vulnerable to be detected and mitigated.

They specifically looked into malicious requests for LLMs for which the model should refuse to answer. In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenAI 2023</a>). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output <strong>affirmative</strong> responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Sure, here is how to ..."</code>. The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"sure"</code> response.
