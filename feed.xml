Traditionally, AI models trained for complex reasoning tasks leverage large datasets composed of human-annotated examples. However, such datasets often lack comprehensive coverage and may not contain optimal solutions. RL circumvents this limitation by allowing AI models to explore solutions autonomously, refining their strategies based on reward-driven feedback mechanisms.</li> <li>Consider an AI model trained to play chess. Instead of learning from a fixed dataset of historical games, the AI is programmed with only the fundamental rules of chess. It then engages in self-play, continuously experimenting with various moves. Initially, the model executes suboptimal actions, leading to losses. However, through iterative play, it identifies effective strategies and reinforces moves that contribute to victories while discarding ineffective ones. This trial-and-error process, governed by RL principles, enables the AI to develop strategies surpassing human intuition.</li> <li>DeepSeek applies this RL-based approach to reasoning-intensive domains, such as mathematical problem-solving. Rather than training on explicit mathematical derivations, the AI is provided with fundamental mathematical rules and tasked with solving problems autonomously. The model systematically explores various solution paths, reinforcing those that yield correct answers while discarding ineffective methodologies. Over time, this process enhances the AI’s mathematical reasoning abilities beyond traditional supervised learning approaches.

Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</h4> <ul> <li>GRPO, introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300">DeepSeekMath</a>, is a RL method that has played a pivotal role in the development of DeepSeek-R1. It is a simplified and cost-efficient alternative to traditional policy optimization techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), since it does not require a separate critic model. Instead, it estimates the baseline from a group of generated outputs, reducing computational overhead while maintaining sample efficiency. This group-based approach ensures that each update step improves on previous iterations without overfitting to individual trajectories.</li> <li>GRPO has evolved from a mathematical reasoning optimizer in DeepSeekMath to a core optimization technique in DeepSeek-R1, driving advanced reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks.

Instead of learning a value function, GRPO derives relative rewards from multiple sampled responses. This enables efficient and stable policy updates while reducing computational overhead.</li> </ul> <h6 id="grpo-intuition">GRPO Intuition</h6> <ul> <li> <p>To understand GRPO, it is useful to analyze its mathematical formulation from a reverse-engineering perspective. The complexity of the equations can be misleading; in reality, GRPO consists of three main components:</p> <p>JGRPO=min([Block 1],[Block 2])−[Block 3]</p> <ul> <li>where: <ul> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Block 1 corresponds to the first term inside the summation of the GRPO objective function: ρiAi=πθ(oi</td> <td>q)πθold(oi</td> <td>q)Ai. This represents the primary objective of policy optimization: ensuring the updated policy πθ improves upon the previous policy πθold. The core principle is straightforward: the new policy should outperform the old one in expectation.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li>Block 2 corresponds to the clipped version of ρiAi, i.e., clip(ρi,1−ϵ,1+ϵ)Ai. This originates from PPO and serves as a safeguard to prevent excessive updates. By taking the minimum between Block 1 and this clipped value, GRPO ensures training stability and prevents over-exaggerated policy updates.</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Block 3 corresponds to the KL-divergence regularization term in the GRPO equation: βDKL(πθ</td> <td> </td> <td>πref). This term enforces similarity between the new policy and a reference policy, preventing the optimization process from deviating too far from the original distribution and ensuring controlled updates.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>One of the most notable aspects of GRPO’s success is its redesigned approach to advantage computation. Traditional PPO computes advantages using a learned value network combined with temporal difference learning, requiring additional memory and computation to maintain a separate critic model. In contrast, GRPO fundamentally simplifies this by directly comparing sampled actions within a group and leveraging statistical normalization to compute advantages. This group-based methodology eliminates the need for a value network, significantly reducing memory overhead—by approximately half—while simultaneously aligning with the core principle of evaluating mathematical solutions relative to other approaches to the same problem.</li> <li>This design choice has proven especially effective for mathematical reasoning tasks. By using a direct group-based comparison, GRPO enhances the model’s ability to develop structured reasoning strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that this method not only improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks but also maintains training stability and computational efficiency. The elimination of the critic network removes potential biases from learned value functions, making GRPO particularly well-suited for domains requiring objective evaluation of multiple solution paths.</li> <li>Additionally, the “Group” aspect in GRPO refers to computing the expectation over a set of sampled outputs, which are then averaged to stabilize training. The presence of normalization within A (mean and standard deviation) may initially appear complex, but it simply follows conventional normalization techniques used in machine learning.</li> <li>Thus, when stripped of indices, subscripts, and hyperparameters, GRPO reduces to a simple balance between policy improvement and control mechanisms, reinforcing why it is regarded as an efficient and

This is my personal notebook.</p> <p>The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT. We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via <a href="https://github.com/opendilab/awesome-RLHF">RLHF</a>). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.</p> <p>A large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.</p> <p>There is also a branch of work on attacking LLMs to extract pre-training data, private knowledge (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805">Carlini et al, 2020</a>) or attacking model training process via data poisoning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10149">Carlini et al. 2023</a>). We would not cover those topics in this post.</p> <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2> <h3 id="threat-model">Threat Model</h3> <p>Adversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired. Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/threats-overview.png" alt="overview"/></p> <p>Fig. 1. An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173">Greshake et al. 2023</a>)</p> <h3 id="classification">Classification</h3> <p>Adversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $x$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $x_{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $x$, such that $f(x) \neq f(x_{adv})$.</p> <h3 id="text-generation">Text Generation</h3> <p>Given an input $x$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $y ~ p(.|x)$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(x)$ that $y$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $y$ is unsafe or human review.</p> <h3 id="white-box-vs-black-box">White-box vs Black-box</h3> <p>White-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models. Black-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $x$ and get back sample $y$, without knowing further information about the model.</p> <h3 id="types-of-adversarial-attacks">Types of Adversarial Attacks</h3> <p>There are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Attack</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Token manipulation</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Alter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gradient based attack</td> <td>White-box</td> <td>Rely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jailbreak prompting</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Often heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Human red-teaming</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Human attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Model red-teaming</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Model attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="token-manipulation">Token Manipulation</h3> <p>Given a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.</p> <p>Ribeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.</p> <p>In comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei &amp; Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion.

BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.</p> <h2 id="gradient-based-attacks">Gradient based Attacks</h2> <p>In the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.</p> <p><strong>GBDA</strong> (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13733">Guo et al. 2021</a>) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to <em>make adversarial loss optimization differentiable</em>, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens where one token can be sampled from a categorical distribution , where and is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that is usually around and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:</p> <p>where is a vector of token probabilities for the -th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label for a classifier : . However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144">Jang et al. 2016</a>) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution by :</p> <p>where ; the temperature controls the smoothness of the distribution.</p> <p>Gumbel distribution is used to model the <em>extreme</em> value, maximum or minimum, of a number of samples, irrespective of the sample distribution. The additional Gumbel noise brings in the stochastic decisioning that mimic the sampling process from the categorical distribution.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/gumbel.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 2. The probability density plot of .

When the temperature is , it reflects the original categorical distribution. When , it becomes a uniform distribution. The expectations and samples from Gumbel softmax distribution matched well. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144">Jang et al. 2016</a>)</p> <p>Let be the embedding representation of token . We can approximate with , a weighted average of the embedding vector corresponding to the token probabilities: . Note that when is a one-hot vector corresponding to the token , we would have . Combining the embedding representation with the Gumbel-softmax approximation, we have a differentiable objective to minimize: .</p> <p>Meanwhile, it is also easy to apply differentiable soft constraints with white-box attacks. GBDA experimented with (1) a soft fluency constraint using NLL (negative log-likelihood) and (2) BERTScore (<em>“a similarity score for evaluating text generation that captures the semantic similarity between pairwise tokens in contextualized embeddings of a transformer model.”</em>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675">Zhang et al. 2019</a>) to measure similarity between two text inputs to ensure the perturbed version does not diverge from the original version too much. Combining all constraints, the final objective function is as follows, where are preset hyperparameters to control the strength of soft constraints:</p> <p>Gumbel-softmax tricks are hard to be extended to token deletion or addition and thus it is restricted to only token replacement operations, not deletion or addition.</p> <p><strong>HotFlip</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06751">Ebrahimi et al. 2018</a>) treats text operations as inputs in the vector space and measures the derivative of loss with regard to these vectors. Here let’s assume the input vector is a matrix of character-level one-hot encodings, and , where is the maximum number of words, is the maximum number of characters per word and is the alphabet size. Given the original input vector , we construct a new vector with the -th character of the -th word changing from , and thus we have but .</p> <p>The change in loss according to first-order Taylor expansion is:</p> <p>This objective is optimized to select the vector to minimize the adversarial loss using only one backward propagation.</p> <p>To apply multiple flips, we can run a beam search of steps of the beam width , taking forward steps. HotFlip can be extended to token deletion or addition by representing that with multiple flip operations in the form of position shifts.</p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125">Wallace et al. (2019)</a> proposed a gradient-guided search over tokens to find short sequences (E.g. 1 token for classification and 4 tokens for generation), named <strong>Universal Adversarial Triggers</strong> (<strong>UAT</strong>), to trigger a model to produce a specific prediction. UATs are input-agnostic, meaning that these trigger tokens can be concatenated as prefix (or suffix) to any input from a dataset to take effect. Given any text input sequence from a data distribution , attackers can optimize the triggering tokens leading to a target class (, different from the ground truth) :</p> <p>Then let’s apply <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/#hotflip">HotFlip</a> to search for the most effective token based on the change in loss approximated by first-order Taylor expansion. We would convert the triggering tokens into their one-hot embedding representations, each vector of dimension size , form and update the embedding of every trigger tokens to minimize the first-order Taylor expansion:</p> <p>where is the embedding matrix of all the tokens. is the average gradient of the task loss over a batch around the current embedding of the -th token in the adversarial triggering sequence . We can brute-force the optimal by a big dot product of size embedding of the entire vocabulary the embedding dimension . Matrix multiplication of this size is cheap and can be run in parallel.</p> <p><strong>AutoPrompt</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15980">Shin et al., 2020</a>) utilizes the same gradient-based search strategy to find the most effective prompt template for a diverse set of tasks.</p> <p>The above token search method can be augmented with beam search. When looking for the optimal token embedding , we can pick top- candidates instead of a single one, searching from left to right and score each beam by on the current data batch.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UAT.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 4. Illustration of how Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) works. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125">Wallace et al. 2019</a>)</p> <p>The design of the loss for UAT is task-specific. Classification or reading comprehension relies on cross entropy. In their experiment, conditional text generation is configured to maximize the likelihood of a language model generating similar content to a set of bad outputs given any user input:</p> <p>It is impossible to exhaust the entire space of in practice, but the paper got decent results by representing each set with a small number of examples. For example, their experiments used only 30 manually written racist and non-racist tweets as approximations for respectively. They later found that a small number of examples for and ignoring (i.e. no in the formula above) give good enough results.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UAT-examples.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 5. Samples of Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) on different types of language tasks. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125">Wallace et al. 2019</a>)</p> <p>Why UATs work is an interesting question. Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.</p> <p>One drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02392">Mehrabi et al. (2022)</a> studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations. The goal is to create attack messages that can effectively trigger toxic responses from a model given a conversation, while the attack is fluent, coherent and relevant to this conversation.</p> <p>They explored two variations of UAT:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Variation #1: <strong>UAT-LM</strong> (Universal Adversarial Trigger with Language Model Loss) adds a constraint on language model logprob on the trigger tokens, , to encourage the model to learn sensical token combination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Variation #2: <strong>UTSC</strong> (Unigram Trigger with Selection Criteria) follows a few steps to generate attack messages by (1) first generating a set of <em>unigram</em> UAT tokens, (2) and then passing these unigram triggers and conversation history to the language model to generate different attack utterances. Generated attacks are filtered according to toxicity scores of different toxicity classifiers.

In an experiment by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00614v2">Jain et al. 2023</a>, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"I'm sorry. As a ..."</code> response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.</p> <p><a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/#gradient-based-attacks">White-box attacks</a> often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/#UAT-LM">UAT-LM</a>, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/PPL-passed.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). “PPL Passed” and “PPL Window Passed” are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is.

MI-FGSM improves the itertive FGSM (i-FGSM or BIM) by adding a momenumt which helps to overcome local minima and hence the adversarial examples transfer better. However, it is a sign-based attack method, where the sign gives an bound of the magnitude of the gradient step. Sign-based methods fail to converge to the optimum in convex settings. To address these concerns, the authors propose a novel method (AdaMSI-FGM), which incorporates both an innovative adaptive momentum parameter with monotonicity assumptions and an adaptive step-size scheme that replaces the sign operation.</p> <h2 id="key-insights">Key insights</h2> <ul> <li>Sign-based attack methods are well-known and this better showed there is still research to be done.</li> <li>The sign method can be replaced with an adaptive update step.</li> <li>Derive a regret upper bound for general convex functions.</li> </ul> <h1 id="references">References</h1> <ul> <li>[1] <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29323">On the Convergence of an Adaptive Momentum Method for Adversarial Attack, 2024, AAAI.</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="adversarial-examples"/><category term="paper"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the Convergence of an Adaptive Momentum Method for Adversarial Attacks]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A complete list of all (arXiv) model stealing papers (under construction)</title><link href="https://lorenz-peter.github.io/blog/2024/rw_ms/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A complete list of all (arXiv) model stealing papers (under construction)"/><published>2024-12-21T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-21T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://lorenz-peter.github.io/blog/2024/rw_ms</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lorenz-peter.github.io/blog/2024/rw_ms/"><![CDATA[<p>by Peter Lorenz</p> <h3 id="description">Description</h3> <p>Staying current with the latest research can be a daunting task, given the rapid increase in publications each year.
