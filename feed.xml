While proprietary models, such as GPT-4, have demonstrated strong performance across various natural language tasks, including mathematics, most open-source LLMs have lagged, particularly in complex, multistep quantitative reasoning tasks.</p> <p>This paper directly addresses that gap by introducing a comprehensive framework—<strong>Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF)</strong>—which boosts both performance and data efficiency for mathematical problem-solving, primarily focusing on freely available model families like Llama and Mistral. <br/> The Evol-Instruct method was introduced in the WizardLM approach, and the authors extended it to the mathematical domain. They created a robust mathematical supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. The introduction of new reward models—combining an Instruction Reward Model (IRM) and Process Reward Model (PRM)—for reinforcement learning in mathematics improves performance in the experiments.</p> <p>WizardMath Mistral 7B outperforms existing open-source models. The experimental results show the effectiveness of different model sizes (number of billion parameters) and WizardMath 70B even exceeds proprietary models, those as strong proprietary models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4-early-version. <br/> It should be noted that open-source models are usually (except Llama or DeepSeekMath) not necessarily pre-trained on mathematical datasets, and how proprietary models are trained is a secret or only partially disclosed. Further, in the result Table 1 (see [1]), it should be considered that WizardMath is a model trained with both SFT and reinforcement learning (RL), whereas typically other models are not fine-tuned via RL. It would be interesting to see how the other models might also benefit comparably from RL for a more insightful evaluation. Moreover, WizardMath relies on the proprietary GPT-4 model for PRM, which makes it challenging to fully agree with the authors’ characterization of WizardMath as a fair comparison to open-source models.</p> <p>While not explicitly stated in the paper, recent trends include the use of WizardMath to enhance agentic AI, enabling autonomous problem-solving and decision-making in complex environments. This aligns with industries requiring verifiable, step-by-step reasoning for high-stakes decisions, driving progress in fields like robotics and scientific research.</p> <p>In summary, WizardMath is a milestone for open-source mathematical LLMs, demonstrating that process-supervised RL with diversified, AI-evolved math data can vault open models into (and beyond) the realm previously dominated by closed, expensive alternatives.</p> <h1 id="analysis-report">Analysis Report</h1> <h2 id="1-context">1. Context</h2> <p>Large-scale language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention and become the preferred solution for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as open-domain conversations, coding, and mathematics.</p> <p>LLMs are typically pre-trained on vast amounts of internet data and then fine-tuned using specialized instruction data and techniques. This approach enables them to achieve cutting-edge zero-shot performance across multiple benchmarks.</p> <p>This trend also gradually stimulates the releases of open-source models (Mistral, Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM [2]).</p> <p>Closed-source models, like those developed by OpenAI, often perform better in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks due to their more specialized training, optimizations, and proprietary techniques [3]. They tend to have access to more tailored datasets and advanced methods for fine-tuning, which can enhance their performance in areas like multi-step mathematical and scientific reasoning [3,4].</p> <p>The authors emphasize that they excluded external Python tools (such as ToRA [5], MAmmoTH [6], or OpenMathInstruct-2 [7]) from their research. ToRA, for example, focuses not only on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning [5], but also on a system with Agentic AI, where tools are provided to enhance reasoning. In contrast, WizardMath’s contribution is centered on the reasoning process itself, rather than on the system.</p> <p>In 2024, ToRA published its results and is outperforming the WizardMath results from the arXiv version of 2023:</p> <p><em>Notably, TORA-7B reaches 44.6% on the competition-level dataset MATH, surpassing the best open-source model WizardMath-70B by 22% absolute. TORACODE-34B is also the first open-source model that achieves an accuracy exceeding 50% on MATH, which significantly outperforms GPT-4’s CoT result, and is competitive with GPT-4 solving problems with programs.</em></p> <p>There is no direct comparison of the current WizardMath publication and ToRA, which makes the impression that WizardMath won’t be able to at the moment. WizardMath explicitly writes that they only outperform GPT-4 earlier versions.</p> <h2 id="2-technical-contributions-and-innovations">2. Technical Contributions and Innovations</h2> <p>In this section, we will discuss the evol-instruct, reinforcement learning, and automated and scalable approach.</p> <p>Note: In Appendix A2 - remarks by the reviewers: <br/> <em>While the empirical results are strong, some reviewers see the novelty as moderate because both the Evol-Instruct framework and PRM methodology existed previously—the paper “basically took Evol-Instruct and PRM and used them to train a model”.</em></p> <p>In Figure 1 (copied from [1]), the 3 steps of the WizardMath method are illustrated.</p> <p><img src="wizardmath/yNZ_Image_1.png" alt="Enter image alt description"/></p> <p>As illustrated in Figure 1, the authors propose a novel method called Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF). This approach aims to generate diverse math instruction data through a newly introduced framework, Math Evol-Instruct, which incorporates both downward and upward evolution processes. The downward evolution generates grade school math problems, while the upward evolution tackles more challenging high school-level math. (More in Section 2.1)</p> <p>In contrast to WizardLM [2] and WizardCoder [8], which primarily focus on the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage and are prone to learning hallucinated information from the teacher model, the authors of this study introduce the innovative use of a Process-Reward Model (PRM). This model addresses the issue of false positives that can arise during the problem-solving process.</p> <p>To prevent the instruction evolution from becoming uncontrollable, the authors also introduce an Instruction Reward Model (IRM). The IRM is designed to evaluate the quality of the evolved instructions, while the PRM provides feedback on each reasoning step during the solution process. These two reward models are trained using existing research [9-12]. (More in Section 2.2)</p> <p>The training process begins by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with the evolved math data. Subsequently, GPT-4 is employed to produce a ranking order of the instructions and assess the correctness of each reasoning step. The LLMs are then optimized to incorporate this feedback into the reward models. Finally, a Step-by-Step Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [13] approach is used to train the model, WizardMath, ensuring it adapts to the evolving instructions while maintaining accuracy.</p> <h2 id="21-math-evol-instruct-diversified-synthetic-data-generation">2.1 Math Evol-Instruct: Diversified Synthetic Data Generation</h2> <ul> <li> <p>The <strong>Evol-Instruct</strong> [1, 2] methodology employs upward and downward evolution to create diverse and complex math problems.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Upward Evolution</strong> increases the complexity and constraints of existing problems, leading to more challenging questions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Downward Evolution</strong> (a novel addition) simplifies problems, creating easier variants.

Conclusion</h2> <p>WizardMath represents a significant advancement in the domain of open-source mathematical large language models (LLMs). It illustrates that process-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) combined with a diverse, AI-generated mathematical data set can propel open models to achieve, and even exceed, the performance levels traditionally seen in closed, highly costly alternatives. Its exceptional performance across core benchmarks and generalization tasks, alongside a robust and scalable training pipeline, underscores both novel scientific insights and technical expertise, thereby setting a new benchmark within the field.</p> <p>In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, the framework introduced by WizardMath not only pushes the boundaries of the current state-of-the-art but also establishes critical paradigms—such as process-based supervision, data-driven evolution, and automated reward modeling. These are poised to serve as foundational elements for future developments in language, mathematics, and broader scientific disciplines.</p> <h1 id="references">References</h1> <p>[1] WizardMath: <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=mMPMHWOdOy">https://openreview.net/forum?id=mMPMHWOdOy</a> <br/> [2] WizardLM: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244</a> <br/> [3] LLM Math Reasoning - Progresses and challenges: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00157">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00157</a> <br/> [4] On LLMs-Driven Synthetic Data Generation, Curation, and Evaluation: A Survey <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15126">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15126</a> <br/> [5] ToRA <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ToRA">https://github.com/microsoft/ToRA</a> <br/> [6] MAmmoth <a href="https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/MAmmoTH">https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/MAmmoTH</a> <br/> [7] OpenMathInstruct-2 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01560">https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01560</a> <br/> [8] WizardCoder <a href="https://wizardlm.github.io/WizardCoder">https://wizardlm.github.io/WizardCoder</a> <br/> [9] Let’s verify step by step <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v8L0pN6EOi">https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v8L0pN6EOi</a> <br/> [10] Solving math word problems with process- and outcome-based feedback <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14275">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14275</a> <br/> [11] Math-Shepherd <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08935">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08935</a> <br/> [12] Common 7B Language Models Already Possess Strong Math Capabilities <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04706">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04706</a> <br/> [13] PPO <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_ppo.html">https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_ppo.html</a> <br/> [14] MMEVOL <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1009">https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1009</a> <br/> [15] Smaller Language Models Are Better Instruction Evolvers <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11231v1">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11231v1</a> <br/> [16] Mathfusion <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16212">https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16212</a></p> <h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1> <h2 id="a1-google-scholar-analysis">A1.

Reviews Summarization</h2> <p>The reviews of “WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct” highlight both substantial strengths and notable weaknesses in the work.</p> <p><strong>What reviewers found good:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strong empirical results:</strong> Reviewers consistently praised the paper for achieving impressive gains in mathematical reasoning, often exceeding those of strong proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Claude2. One reviewer noted that improvements from training on Math Evol-Instruct were “more than 10 points,” and that surpassing proprietary models is significant and attention-worthy. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thorough experiments and ablations:</strong> The paper presents exhaustive experiments over a wide range of model scales (from 100M to 70B parameters), using different base models, and compares against several math-specific baselines. The ablation studies and analyses are seen as solid evidence of the method’s advantages and scalability. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Novel methodological components:</strong> The introduction of new reward models—an Instruction Reward Model (IRM) and Process Reward Model (PRM)—for reinforcement learning in mathematics is considered a valuable innovation. Experimentally, integrating IRM with PRM is shown to robustly improve performance. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scalability and automation:</strong> The model training pipeline is largely automated using AI, including fully automated instruction evolution and reward data generation, which reviewers noted as a scalable and adaptable feature that could potentially be applied beyond math (e.g., in coding domains). \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clear practical impact:</strong> The experiments demonstrate consistent, robust improvements over open and closed alternatives, which reviewers interpret as deliverable value to the NLP and AI research community. \</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>What reviewers found bad or problematic:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Unfair baseline comparisons:</strong> Multiple reviewers criticized the fairness of comparisons in the results tables. Specifically, WizardMath is a model trained with both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), whereas many baselines have only undergone SFT. They argue that other models might also benefit comparably from RL, and comparisons should be more rigorously controlled, isolating the effects of SFT and RL. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reliance on GPT-4 labeling for PRM:</strong> Some concerns using GPT-4 for annotating process reward model (PRM) training data may not scale well to much larger datasets and could limit generalizability, though reviewers acknowledge that this enables full automation and seems effective in practice. \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Presentation and clarity:</strong> The presentation was described as “messy” and at times unclear. Some technical terms and methodological concepts, like “Evol-Instruct”, were referenced before explanation, certain dataset descriptions (like grade school vs high school tasks) appeared and disappeared without clear discussion, and main tables (such as Table 1) omitted important baseline scores. There were also typos and confusing figures (e.g., Figure 1). \</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Marginality of contribution:</strong> While the empirical results are strong, some reviewers see the novelty as moderate because both the Evol-Instruct framework and PRM methodology existed previously—the paper “basically took Evol-Instruct and PRM and used them to train a model”.

The idea of cross features was first popularized in Google’s 2016 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792">Wide &amp; Deep Learning for Recommender Systems</a> by Cheng et al.</li> <li><strong>Wide and Deep model architectures</strong> in recommender systems combine a linear model for the “wide” part, which captures <a href="https://aman.ai/recsys/architectures/#what-are-feature-crosses-and-why-are-they-important">cross-feature interactions</a> that models nonlinear interactions between the original features, with a NCF model for the “deep” part, which learns complex feature relationships and interactions. This hybrid approach balances memorization and generalization by capturing both specific feature combinations and broader patterns in the data.</li> </ul> <h3 id="background-cross-features">Background: Cross Features</h3> <h4 id="what-are-feature-crosses-and-why-are-they-important">What are Feature Crosses and Why are They Important?</h4> <ul> <li>A cross feature is a second-order feature (i.e., a cross-product transformation) that is created by “crossing” two sparse/categorical features (using the multiplication operation), thus modeling the interactive effects between the two features. Cross features capture nonlinear interactions between the original features, allowing the model to account for relationships that linear models would miss. In real-world problems, features often interact, meaning the effect of one feature on the output depends on the value of another feature.</li> <li>By modeling these interactions, cross features allow recommender systems to capture more complex relationships in the data, improving recommendations and ultimately, user engagement.</li> <li>For example, in an ad-click prediction system, consider the device type and time of day as two features. Their interaction could significantly affect the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad. For instance, users may be more likely to click on ads from their mobile device during evening hours when they are casually browsing, compared to when they are at work on a computer during the day. Such nonlinear interactions between these original features can be effectively modeled and captured through cross features, enabling the system to make more accurate predictions.</li> <li> <p>As another example, in the Google Play Store, first-order features include the impressed app, or the list of user-installed apps. These two can be combined to create powerful cross features, such as:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;user_installed_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'netflix'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;impression_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'hulu'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre></div> </div> <ul> <li>which is 1 if the user has Netflix installed <em>and</em> the impressed app is Hulu.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Cross features can also be more coarse-grained, such as:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> &lt;span&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;user_installed_category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'video'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;impression_category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'video'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre></div> </div> <ul> <li>which is 1 if the user installed video apps before <em>and</em> the impressed app is a video app as well. The authors argue that adding cross features of different granularities enables both memorization (from more granular crosses) and generalization (from less granular crosses).</li> </ul> </li> <li>As another example (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders/examples/dcn">source</a>), imagine we are building a recommender system to sell a “blender” to customers. A customer’s past purchase history, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">purchased_bananas</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">purchased_cooking_books</code>, or geographic features, are single features. If a customer has purchased both bananas and cooking books, then this customer will more likely click on the recommended blender. The combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">purchased_bananas</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">purchased_cooking_books</code> is referred to as a feature cross, which provides additional interaction information beyond the individual features.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/recsys/assets/architectures/Cross.gif" alt=""/></p> <h4 id="what-are-the-challenges-in-learning-feature-crosses">What are the Challenges in Learning Feature Crosses?</h4> <ul> <li>In web-scale applications, data is mostly categorical, leading to a large and sparse feature space. Identifying effective feature crosses in this setting often requires manual feature engineering or exhaustive search.</li> <li>Traditional feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) models are universal function approximators; however, they cannot efficiently approximate even 2nd or 3rd-order feature crosses (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13535.pdf">Wang et al. (2020)</a>, <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/18fa88ad519f25dc4860567e19ab00beff3f01cb.pdf">Beutel et al. (2018)</a>).</li> </ul> <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3> <ul> <li>Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. However, memorization and generalization are both important for recommender systems. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>The Wide and Deep architecture demonstrated the critical importance of cross features, that is, second-order features that are created by crossing two of the original features. It combines a wide (and shallow) module for cross features with a deep (and narrow) module much like <a href="https://aman.ai/recsys/architectures/#neural-collaborative-filtering-2017">NCF</a>. It seeks to obtain the best of both worlds by combining the unique strengths of wide and deep models, i.e., memorization and generalization respectively, thus enabling better recommendations.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>Wide and Deep learning jointly train wide linear models and deep neural networks – to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. Wide linear models can effectively memorize sparse feature interactions using cross-product feature transformations, while deep neural networks can generalize to previously unseen feature interactions through low dimensional embeddings.</li> </ul> <h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3> <blockquote> <p><strong>Wide part:</strong> The wide part of the model is a generalized linear model that takes into account cross-product feature transformations, in addition to the original features. The cross-product transformations capture interactions between categorical features. For example, if you were building a real estate recommendation system, you might include a cross-product transformation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">city=San Francisco</code> AND <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type=condo</code>. These cross-product transformations can effectively capture specific, niche rules, offering the model the benefit of <strong>memorization</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Deep part:</strong> The deep part of the model is a feed-forward neural network that takes all features as input, both categorical and continuous. However, categorical features are typically transformed into embeddings first, as neural networks work with continuous data. The deep part of the model excels at generalizing patterns from the data to unseen examples, offering the model the benefit of <strong>generalization</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>As a recap, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response/outcome variables to have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. GLMs are used to model relationships between a response/outcome variable and one or more predictor variables. Examples of GLMs include logistic regression (used for binary outcomes like pass/fail), Poisson regression (for count data), and linear regression (for continuous data with a normal distribution).</li> <li>As an example <a href="https://blog.research.google/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">(source)</a>, say you’re trying to offer food/beverage recommendations based on an input query. People looking for specific items like “iced decaf latte with nonfat milk” really mean it. Just because it’s pretty close to “hot latte with whole milk” in the embedding space doesn’t mean it’s an acceptable alternative. Similarly, there are millions of these rules where the transitivity (a relation between three elements such that if it holds between the first and second and it also holds between the second and third, it must necessarily hold between the first and third) of embeddings may actually do more harm than good.</li> <li>On the other hand, queries that are more exploratory like “seafood” or “italian food” may be open to more generalization and discovering a diverse set of related items.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Building upon the food recommendation example earlier, as shown in the graph below <a href="https://blog.research.google/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">(source)</a>, sparse features like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">query="fried chicken"</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">item="chicken fried rice"</code> are used in both the wide part (left) and the deep part (right) of the model.</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/Wide&amp;Deep2.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>For the wide component utilizing a generalized linear model, cross-product transformations are carried out on the binary features (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND(gender=female, language=en)</code>) is 1 if and only if the constituent features (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gender=female</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">language=en</code>) are all 1, and 0 otherwise. This captures the interactions between the binary features, and adds non-linearity to the generalized linear model.</li> <li>For the deep component utilizing a feed-forward neural network, each of the sparse, high-dimensional categorical features are first converted into a low-dimensional, dense real-valued vector, often referred to as an embedding vector. The dimensionality of the embeddings are usually on the order of O(10) to O(100). The embedding vectors are initialized randomly and then the values are trained to minimize the final loss function during model training.</li> <li>During training, the prediction errors are backpropagated to both sides to train the model parameters, i.e., the two models function as one “cohesive” architecture and are trained jointly with the same loss function.</li> <li>The figure below from the paper shows how Wide and Deep models form a sweet middle compared to just Wide and just Deep models:</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/Wide&amp;Deep.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>Thus, the key architectural choice in Wide and Deep is to have both a wide module, which is a linear model that takes all cross features directly as inputs, and a deep module, which is essentially an <a href="https://aman.ai/recsys/architectures/#neural-collaborative-filtering-2017">NCF</a>, and then combine both modules into a single output task head that learns from user/app engagements. The architectural diagram below <a href="https://medium.com/better-ml/recsys-model-serving-model-architectures-serving-1b5f038848bd">(source)</a> showcases this structure.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/recsys/assets/architectures/4.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>By combining these two components, Wide and Deep models aim to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization, which can be particularly useful in recommendation systems, where both aspects can be important. The wide part can capture specific item combinations that a particular user might like (based on historical data), while the deep part can generalize from user behavior to recommend items that the user hasn’t interacted with yet but might find appealing based on their broader preferences. Put simply, Wide and Deep architectures combine a deep neural network component for capturing complex patterns and a wide component using a generalized linear model that models feature interactions explicitly. This allows the model to learn both deep representations and exploit feature interactions, providing a balance between memorization and generalization.</li> <li> <p>In the Wide &amp; Deep Learning model, both the wide and deep components handle sparse features, but in different ways:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Wide Component</strong>: <ul> <li>The wide component is a generalized linear model that uses raw input features and transformed features.</li> <li>An important transformation in the wide component is the cross-product transformation.

Prior to NCF, the gold standard in recommender systems was matrix factorization, which relied on learning latent vectors (a.k.a. embeddings) for both users and items, and then generate recommendations for a user by taking the dot product between the user vector and the item vectors. The closer the dot product is to 1, the better the match. As such, matrix factorization can be simply viewed as a linear model of latent factors.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>The key idea behind NCF is to substitute the inner product in matrix factorization with a neural network architecture to that can learn an arbitrary non-linear function from data. To supercharge the learning process of the user-item interaction function with non-linearities, they concatenated user and item embeddings, and then fed them into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a single task head predicting user engagement, like clicks. Both MLP weights and embedding weights (which user/item IDs are mapped to) were learned through backpropagation of loss gradients during model training.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>The hypothesis underpinning NCF posits that user-item interactions are non-linear, contrary to the linear assumption in matrix factorization.</li> <li>The figure below from the paper illustrates the neural collaborative filtering framework.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/NCF.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>NCF proved the value of replacing (then standard) linear matrix factorization algorithms with a neural network.

As shown in the below figure, AutoInt takes the sparse feature vector x as input, followed by an embedding layer that projects all features (i.e., both categorical and numerical features) into the same low-dimensional space. Next, embeddings of all fields are fed into a novel interacting layer, which is implemented as a multi-head self-attentive neural network. For each interacting layer, high-order features are combined through the attention mechanism, and different kinds of combinations can be evaluated with the multi-head mechanisms, which map the features into different subspaces. By stacking multiple interacting layers, different orders of combinatorial features can be modeled. The output of the final interacting layer is the low-dimensional representation of the input feature, which models the high-order combinatorial features and is further used for estimating the clickthrough rate through a sigmoid function.

This approach is not only inefficient but also risks creating feature crosses that offer no meaningful value, leading to model overfitting.</li> <li>What is required, therefore, is a method to automatically identify which feature interactions are significant and which can be disregarded. The solution, as you might expect, is self-attention.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>AutoInt introduces the concept of multi-head self-attention within recommender systems: instead of generating all possible pairwise feature crosses through brute force, attention mechanisms are employed to discern which feature crosses are truly relevant.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>This was the key innovation behind AutoInt, short for “automated feature interaction learning,” as proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11921">Song et al. (2019)</a> from Peking University, China. Specifically, the authors first project each feature into a 16-dimensional embedding space, and then pass these embeddings through a stack of multi-head self-attention layers, which automatically identify the most informative feature interactions. The inputs to the key, query, and value matrices are simply the list of all feature embeddings, and the attention function is a dot product, chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing feature interactions.</li> <li>Although this may sound complex, there is no real mystery—just a series of matrix multiplications. For instance, the attention matrix learned by one of the attention heads in AutoInt for the MovieLens benchmark dataset is shown below:</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/recsys/assets/architectures/aint2.webp" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>The model learns that feature crosses such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Genre-Gender</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Genre-Age</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RequestTime-ReleaseTime</code> are important, highlighted in green. This makes sense, as men and women typically have different movie preferences, and children often prefer different films compared to adults. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RequestTime-ReleaseTime</code> feature cross captures the movie’s freshness at the time of the training instance.</li> <li>By utilizing a stack of three attention layers, each with two heads, the authors of AutoInt were able to outperform several competitors, including Wide and Deep and DeepFM, on the MovieLens and Criteo benchmark datasets.</li> </ul> <h2 id="dlrm-2019">DLRM (2019)</h2> <ul> <li>Let’s fast-forward by a year to Meta’s DLRM (“deep learning for recommender systems”) architecture, proposed in <a href="https://aman.ai/recsys/architectures/](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00091)">Naumov et al. (2019)</a>, another important milestone in recommender system modeling.</li> <li>This paper by Naumov et al. from Facebook in 2019 introduces the DLRM (deep learning for recommender systems) architecture, a significant development in recommender system modeling, which was open-sourced in both PyTorch and Caffe2 frameworks.</li> <li>Contrary to the “deep learning” part in it’s name, DLRM represents a progression from the DeepFM architecture, maintaining the FM (factorization machine) component while discarding the deep neural network part. The fundamental hypothesis of DLRM is that interactions are paramount in recommender systems, which can be modeled using shallow MLPs (and complex deep learning components are thus not essential).</li> <li>The DLRM model handles continuous (dense) and categorical (sparse) features that describe users and products. DLRM exercises a wide range of hardware and system components, such as memory capacity and bandwidth, as well as communication and compute resources as shown in the figure below from the paper.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/dlrm.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>The figure below from the paper shows the overall structure of DLRM.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/dlrm2.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>DLRM uniquely handles both continuous (dense) and categorical (sparse) features that describe users and products, projecting them into a shared embedding space. These features are then passed through MLPs before and after computing pairwise feature interactions (dot products). This method significantly differs from other neural network-based recommendation models in its explicit computation of feature interactions and treatment of each embedded feature vector as a single unit, contrasting with approaches like Deep and Cross which consider each element in the feature vector separately.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>DLRM shows that interactions are all you need: it’s akin to using just the FM component of DeepFM but with MLPs added before and after the interactions to increase modeling capacity.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>The architecture of DLRM includes multiple MLPs, which are added to increase the model’s capacity and expressiveness, enabling it to model more complex interactions. This aspect is critical as it allows for fitting data with higher precision, given adequate parameters and depth in the MLPs.</li> <li>Compared to other DL-based approaches to recommendation, DLRM differs in two ways. First, it computes the feature interactions explicitly while limiting the order of interaction to pairwise interactions. Second, DLRM treats each embedded feature vector (corresponding to categorical features) as a single unit, whereas other methods (such as Deep and Cross) treat each element in the feature vector as a new unit that should yield different cross terms. These design choices help reduce computational/memory cost while maintaining competitive accuracy.</li> <li>A key contribution of DLRM is its specialized parallelization scheme, which utilizes model parallelism on the embedding tables to manage memory constraints and exploits data parallelism in the fully-connected layers for computational scalability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with diverse hardware and system components, like memory capacity and bandwidth, as well as communication and compute resources.</li> <li>The paper demonstrates that DLRM surpasses the performance of the DCN model on the Criteo dataset, validating the authors’ hypothesis about the predominance of feature interactions. Moreover, DLRM has been characterized for its performance on the Big Basin AI platform, proving its utility as a benchmark for future algorithmic experimentation, system co-design, and benchmarking in the field of deep learning-based recommendation models.</li> <li><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/dlrm-an-advanced-open-source-deep-learning-recommendation-model/">Facebook AI</a> post.</li> </ul> <h3 id="summary-6">Summary</h3> <ul> <li>The key idea behind DLRM is to take the approach from DeepFM but only keep the FM part, not the Deep part, and expand on top of that. The underlying hypothesis is that the interactions of features are really all that matter in recommender systems. “Interactions are all you need!”, you may say.</li> <li>The deep component is not really needed. DLRM uses a bunch of MLPs to model feature interactions. Under the hood, DLRM projects all sparse and dense features into the same embedding space, passes them through MLPs (blue triangles in the above figure), computes all pairs of feature interactions (the cloud), and finally passes this interaction signal through another MLP (the top blue triangle). The interactions here are simply dot products, just like in DeepFM.</li> <li>The key difference to the DeepFM’s “FM” though is the addition of all these MLPs, the blue triangles. Why do we need those? Because they’re adding modeling capacity and expressiveness, allowing us to model more complex interactions. After all, one of the most important rules in neural networks is that given enough parameters, MLPs with sufficient depth and width can fit data to arbitrary precision!</li> <li>In the paper, the authors show that DLRM beats DCN on the Criteo dataset. The authors’ hypothesis proved to be true. Interactions, it seems, may really be all you need.</li> </ul> <h2 id="dcn-v2-2020">DCN V2 (2020)</h2> <ul> <li>Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13535">DCN V2: Improved Deep &amp; Cross Network and Practical Lessons for Web-scale Learning to Rank Systems</a> by Wang et al. from Google, DCN V2 is an enhanced version of the Deep &amp; Cross Network (DCN), designed to effectively learn feature interactions in large-scale learning to rank (LTR) systems.</li> <li>The paper addresses DCN’s limited expressiveness in learning predictive feature interactions, especially in web-scale systems with extensive training data.</li> <li>DCN V2 is focused on the efficient and effective learning of predictive feature interactions, a crucial aspect of applications like search recommendation systems and computational advertising.

This makes DCN V2 better suited for large-scale, web-based recommendation systems while maintaining efficiency.</li> </ul> <h4 id="dcn">DCN</h4> <ul> <li>The model structure in DCN consists of two parallel networks: <ul> <li><strong>Deep Network (DNN)</strong>: The DNN is responsible for capturing implicit feature interactions, which are complex and nonlinear. The deep network uses multiple fully connected layers, allowing the model to learn intricate relationships between features that are not easily captured by simple feature crossing.</li> <li><strong>Cross Network</strong>: This part of the model is designed to capture explicit feature interactions up to a fixed degree (bounded by the number of layers in the cross network). The cross layers systematically apply feature crosses at each level, combining the original features with the output of the previous cross layer to form higher-degree feature interactions. The cross network is particularly efficient in modeling lower-order feature crosses without the need for manual feature engineering.</li> <li><strong>Parallel Structure</strong>: In DCN, both the DNN and cross network operate in parallel. The input features are passed through both networks, and their respective outputs are concatenated in the final logits layer for prediction. This parallel approach is effective at capturing both implicit and explicit interactions in the data, allowing DCN to perform well without requiring exhaustive feature engineering.</li> <li><strong>Drawback</strong>: However, this structure might be limiting in cases where the sequential dependency between explicit and implicit features is important. The model does not allow for deep interactions between the cross network’s explicit crosses and the deep network’s implicit learning, as both networks run independently.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="dcn-v2">DCN V2</h4> <ul> <li>DCN V2 enhances the flexibility of the model by introducing two ways of combining the deep network and cross network: stacked and parallel structures. <ul> <li><strong>Stacked Structure</strong>: In the stacked architecture, the cross network is applied first to generate explicit feature crosses, and the output of the cross network is then fed into the deep network to learn higher-order implicit interactions. This stacked approach allows the deep network to build upon the explicitly crossed features, enabling a richer, more nuanced learning process. The stacked structure is especially useful in situations where the interactions between explicit feature crosses and deeper, more implicit interactions need to be modeled sequentially. By first capturing simpler, bounded-degree feature crosses in the cross network, the deep network can then focus on learning more complex, high-order interactions that depend on these explicit crosses.</li> <li><strong>Parallel Structure</strong>: Similar to the original DCN, DCN V2 also supports a parallel structure where both the deep network and cross network operate simultaneously. In this approach, the features are processed by both networks concurrently, and their outputs are concatenated for final prediction. This structure is particularly useful for datasets where implicit and explicit interactions are relatively independent, and combining them at the end provides a comprehensive understanding of the data.</li> <li><strong>Combination Layer</strong>: In both the stacked and parallel setups, DCN V2 uses a combination layer to aggregate the outputs of the cross network and deep network before passing them to the final output layer (often a logits layer). Depending on the architecture chosen, the combination can take the form of either a sequential concatenation (in the stacked case) or a direct concatenation of both network outputs (in the parallel case).</li> <li><strong>Flexibility and Adaptation</strong>: This added flexibility enables DCN V2 to better adapt to different types of datasets and tasks. For instance, if the dataset contains feature interactions that are primarily simple and can be captured by bounded-degree crosses, the stacked structure allows the model to first handle these simpler interactions and then apply deep learning for more complex patterns. Alternatively, if the dataset benefits from learning both types of interactions concurrently, the parallel structure can be used. This versatility makes DCN V2 highly customizable and better suited for diverse real-world applications.</li> <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Although the stacked structure adds more depth and complexity to the model, DCN V2 remains computationally efficient by leveraging low-rank techniques and Mixture-of-Experts in the cross layers, ensuring that the additional depth does not significantly increase computational cost or inference time.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Stacked vs. Parallel</strong>: The choice between stacked and parallel structures in DCN V2 depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand: <ul> <li>The stacked structure is more suited for tasks where feature crosses learned by the cross network can directly inform and enrich the implicit interactions learned by the deep network. This sequential dependency enhances the ability to capture more complex feature relationships that depend on simpler interactions.</li> <li>The parallel structure works better for tasks where the explicit and implicit interactions are more independent and do not require one to build on the other. This allows for concurrent learning of different types of interactions, potentially improving the speed and efficiency of learning.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="summary-of-key-differences">Summary of Key Differences</h3> <ul> <li>Here’s a table that provides a detailed comparison, incorporating the technical aspects of both models, and highlights how DCN V2 overcomes the limitations of DCN to provide a more scalable, efficient, and production-ready solution.</li> </ul> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Metric</strong></th> <th><strong>DCN</strong></th> <th><strong>DCN V2</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Cross Features’ Expressiveness</td> <td>Captures nonlinear interactions through cross layers, with expressiveness limited by network depth.</td> <td>Enhanced expressiveness with low-rank techniques and Mixture-of-Experts for higher-order interactions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Scalability</td> <td>Limited scalability as parameter complexity increases with deeper layers.</td> <td>Improved scalability using low-rank factorization, optimizing for large-scale datasets.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Efficiency</td> <td>Efficiency decreases with growing interaction complexity due to higher computational cost.</td> <td>Reduces complexity from O(d2) to O(d×r) using low-rank approximations, improving efficiency.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Model Structure</td> <td>Parallel structure where Cross Network and DNN run independently.</td> <td>Offers both stacked and parallel structures, enabling richer interaction modeling with flexibility.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Handling Higher-Order Interactions</td> <td>Limited by the depth of the Cross Network, with increasing computational overhead.</td> <td>Capable of modeling complex, higher-order interactions efficiently through Mixture-of-Experts.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Flexibility</td> <td>Fixed structure with limited adaptability to different tasks or datasets.</td> <td>Flexible with stacked and parallel setups, adaptable to various datasets and interaction complexities.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Suitable Applications</td> <td>Best suited for smaller systems with limited interaction complexities.</td> <td>Optimized for large-scale, real-time systems, with memory and computational efficiency.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="summary-7">Summary</h3> <ul> <li>Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13535">DCN V2: Improved Deep &amp; Cross Network and Practical Lessons for Web-scale Learning to Rank Systems</a> by Wang et al. from Google.

As a result, extensive efforts have been devoted to designing effective architectures to learn feature interactions. However, they observe that the practical performance of those designs can vary from dataset to dataset, even when the order of interactions claimed to be captured is the same. That indicates different designs may have different advantages and the interactions captured by them have non-overlapping information.</li> <li>Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11014">DHEN: A Deep and Hierarchical Ensemble Network for Large-Scale Click-Through Rate Prediction</a>, this paper by Zhang et al. from Meta introduces DHEN (Deep and Hierarchical Ensemble Network), a novel architecture designed for large-scale Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. The significance of DHEN lies in its ability to learn feature interactions effectively, a crucial aspect in the performance of online advertising services. Recognizing that different interaction models offer varying advantages and capture non-overlapping information, DHEN integrates a hierarchical ensemble framework with diverse interaction modules, including AdvancedDLRM, self-attention, Linear, Deep Cross Net, and Convolution. These modules enable DHEN to learn a hierarchy of interactions across different orders, addressing the limitations and variable performance of previous models on different datasets.</li> <li>The following figure from the paper shows a two-layer two-module hierarchical ensemble (left) and its expanded details (right). A general DHEN can be expressed as a mixture of multiple high-order interactions. Dense feature input for the interaction modules are omitted in this figure for clarity.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/DHEN.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>In CTR prediction tasks, the feature inputs usually contain discrete categorical terms (sparse features) and numerical values (dense features). DHEN uses the same feature processing layer in DLRM, which is shown in the figure below. The sparse lookup tables map the categorical terms to a list of “static” numerical embeddings. Specifically, each categorical term is assigned a trainable d-dimensional vector as its feature representation. On the other hand, the numerical values are processed by dense layers. Dense layers compose of several Multi-layer Perceptions (MLPs) from which an output of a d-dimensional vector is computed. After a concatenation of the output from sparse lookup table and dense layer, the final output of the feature processing layer X0∈Rd×m can be expressed as X0=(x01,x02,…,x0m), where m is the number of the output embeddings and d is the embedding dimension.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/DHEN2.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>A key technical advancement in this work is the development of a co-designed training system tailored for DHEN’s complex, multi-layer structure.

Referring back to the movie example (with features such as user, movie, actors, director), second-order interactions would include user-movie, user-actor, user-director, movie-actor, movie-director, and actor-director. A third-order interaction would involve combinations like user-movie-director, actor-actor-user, director-actor-user, and so forth.</li> <li>For instance, certain users may favor movies directed by Steven Spielberg that feature Tom Hanks, necessitating a cross feature to account for such preferences.

To manage this complexity, the authors of the DHEN paper developed a new distributed training approach called “Hybrid Sharded Data Parallel”, which delivers a 1.2X increase in throughput compared to the then state-of-the-art distributed learning algorithm.</li> <li>Most notably, DHEN proves effective: in their experiments on internal click-through rate data, the authors report a 0.27% improvement in NE compared to DLRM when using a stack of 8 DHEN layers. While such a seemingly small improvement in NE might raise questions about whether it justifies the significant increase in complexity, at Meta’s scale, it likely does.</li> <li>DHEN does not merely represent an incremental improvement over DLRM; it introduces a comprehensive hierarchy of feature interactions, comprising dot products, AutoInt-like self-attention, convolution, linear processing, and DCN-like crossing, replacing DLRM’s simpler dot product approach.</li> </ul> <h2 id="gdcn-2023">GDCN (2023)</h2> <ul> <li>Proposed in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04635">Towards Deeper, Lighter, and Interpretable Cross Network for CTR Prediction</a> by Wang et al. (2023) from Fudan University and Microsoft Research Asia in CIKM ‘23. The paper introduces the Gated Deep Cross Network (GDCN) and the Field-level Dimension Optimization (FDO) approach. GDCN aims to address significant challenges in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction for recommender systems and online advertising, specifically the automatic capture of high-order feature interactions, interpretability issues, and the redundancy of parameters in existing methods.</li> <li>GDCN is inspired by DCN V2 and consists of an embedding layer, a Gated Cross Network (GCN), and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The GCN forms its core structure, which captures explicit bounded-degree high-order feature crosses/interactions. The GCN employs an information gate in each cross layer (representing a higher order interaction) to dynamically filter and amplify important interactions. This gate controls the information flow, ensuring that the model focuses on relevant interactions. This approach not only allows for deeper feature crossing but also adds a layer of interpretability by identifying crucial interactions, thus modelling implicit feature crosses.</li> <li>GDCN is a generalization of DCN V2, offering dynamic instance-based interpretability and the ability to utilize deeper cross features without a loss in performance.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>The unique selling point of DCN V2 is that it treats all cross features equally, while GDCN uses information gates for fine-grained control over feature importance.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>GDCN transforms high-dimensional, sparse input into low-dimensional, dense representations. Unlike most CTR models, GDCN allows arbitrary embedding dimensions.</li> <li>Two structures are proposed: GDCN-S (stacked) and GDCN-P (parallel). GDCN-S feeds the output of GCN into a DNN, while GDCN-P feeds the input vector in parallel into GCN and DNN, concatenating their outputs.</li> <li>Alongside GDCN, the FDO approach focuses on optimizing the dimensions of each field in the embedding layer based on their importance. FDO addresses the issue of redundant parameters by learning independent dimensions for each field based on its intrinsic importance. This approach allows for a more efficient allocation of embedding dimensions, reducing unnecessary parameters and enhancing enhancing efficiency without compromising performance. FDO uses methods like PCA to determine optimal dimensions and only needs to be done once, with the dimensions applicable to subsequent model updates.</li> <li>The following figure shows the architecture of the GDCN-S and GDCN-P. ⊗ is the cross operation (a.k.a, the gated cross layer).</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/GDCN1.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>The following figure visualizes the gated cross layer. ⊙ is elementwise/Hadamard product, and × is matrix multiplication.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/images/papers/GDCN2.jpg" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>Results indicate that GDCN, especially when paired with the FDO approach, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction performance, interpretability, and efficiency. GDCN was evaluated on five datasets (Criteo, Avazu, Malware, Frappe, ML-tag) using metrics like AUC and Logloss, showcasing the effectiveness and superiority of GDCN in capturing deeper high-order interactions. These experiments also demonstrate the interpretability of the GCN model and the successful parameter reduction achieved by the FDO approach. The datasets underwent preprocessing like feature removal for infrequent items and normalization. The comparison included various classes of CTR models and demonstrated GDCN’s effectiveness in handling high-order feature interactions without the drawbacks of overfitting or performance degradation observed in other models. GDCN achieves comparable or better performance with only a fraction (about 23%) of the original model parameters.</li> <li>In summary, GDCN addresses the limitations of existing CTR prediction models by offering a more interpretable, efficient, and effective approach to handling high-order feature interactions, supported by the innovative use of information gates and dimension optimization techniques.</li> </ul> <h2 id="graph-neural-networks-based-recsys-architectures">Graph Neural Networks-based RecSys Architectures</h2> <ul> <li>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures utilize graph structures to capture relationships between users, items, and their interactions. GNNs propagate information through the user-item interaction graph, enabling the model to learn user and item representations that incorporate relational dependencies. This is particularly useful in scenarios with rich graph-based data. <ul> <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Captures relational dependencies and propagates information through graph structures, enabling better modeling of complex relationships. <ul> <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires graph-based data and potentially higher computational resources for training and inference.</li> <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Improved recommendations by incorporating the rich relational information among users, items, and their interactions.</li> <li><strong>Example Use Case:</strong> Social recommendation systems, where user-user connections or item-item relationships play a significant role in personalized recommendations.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Phase:</strong> Candidate Generation, Ranking, Retrieval.</li> <li><strong>Recommendation Workflow:</strong> GNN architectures are suitable for multiple phases of the recommendation workflow. In the candidate generation phase, GNNs can leverage graph structures to capture relational dependencies and generate potential candidate items. In the ranking phase, GNNs can learn user and item embeddings that incorporate relational information, leading to improved ranking. In the retrieval phase, GNNs can assist in efficient retrieval of relevant items based on their graph-based representations.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For a detailed overview of GNNs in RecSys, please refer to the <a href="https://aman.ai/recsys/GNN">GNN primer</a>.</li> </ul> <h2 id="two-towers-in-recsys">Two Towers in RecSys</h2> <ul> <li>One of the most prevalent architectures in personalization and recommendation systems (RecSys) is the two-tower network. This network architecture typically comprises two towers: the user tower (U) and the candidate tower (C). These towers generate dense vector representations (embeddings) of the user and the candidate, respectively. The final layer of the network combines these embeddings using either a dot product or cosine similarity function.</li> <li>Consider the computational costs involved: if the cost of executing the user tower is u, the candidate tower is c, and the dot product is d, then the total cost of ranking N candidates for a single user is N∗(u+c+d). Since the user representation is fixed and computed once, the cost reduces to u+N∗(c+d). Moreover, caching the embeddings can further reduce the cost to u+N∗d+k, where k represents additional fixed overheads. <a href="https://medium.com/better-ml/recsys-model-serving-model-architectures-serving-1b5f038848bd">(source)</a></li> <li>The following image illustrates this concept <a href="https://medium.com/better-ml/recsys-model-serving-model-architectures-serving-1b5f038848bd">(source)</a>:</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/recsys/assets/architectures/2.webp" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>The two-tower architecture consists of two distinct branches: a query tower (user tower) and a candidate tower (item tower). The query tower learns the user’s representation based on their history, while the candidate tower learns item representations from item features. The two towers are combined at the final stage to produce recommendations. <ul> <li><strong>Pros:</strong> This approach explicitly models user and item representations separately, facilitating a better understanding of user preferences and item features.</li> <li><strong>Cons:</strong> It requires additional computation to learn and combine the representations from both the query and candidate towers.</li> <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> This method enhances personalization by learning user and item representations separately, allowing for more granular preference capture.</li> <li><strong>Example Use Case:</strong> This architecture is particularly effective in personalized recommendation systems where understanding both the user’s past behavior and item characteristics is crucial.</li> <li><strong>Phase:</strong> Candidate Generation, Ranking.</li> <li><strong>Recommendation Workflow:</strong> The two-tower architecture is commonly used in the candidate generation and ranking phases. During candidate generation, it allows for the independent processing of user and item features, generating separate representations. In the ranking phase, these representations are merged to assess the relevance of candidate items to the user’s preferences.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The two-tower model gained formal recognition in the machine learning community through Huawei’s 2019 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335771749_PAL_a_position-bias_aware_learning_framework_for_CTR_prediction_in_live_recommender_systems">PAL</a> paper. This model was designed to address biases in ranking models, particularly position bias in recommendation systems.</li> <li>The two-tower architecture typically includes one tower for learning relevance (user/item interactions) and another for learning biases (such as position bias). These towers are combined, either multiplicatively or additively, to generate the final output.</li> <li><strong>Examples of notable two-tower implementations:</strong> <ul> <li>Huawei’s PAL model employs a multiplicative approach to combine the outputs of the two towers, addressing position bias within their app store.</li> <li>YouTube’s “Watch Next” paper introduced an additive two-tower model, which not only mitigates position bias but also considers other selection biases by incorporating features like device type.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The two-tower model has demonstrated significant improvements in recommendation systems. For instance, Huawei’s PAL model improved click-through and conversion rates by approximately 25%. YouTube’s model, by integrating a shallow tower for bias learning, also showed increased engagement metrics.</li> <li><strong>Challenges and considerations:</strong> <ul> <li>A primary challenge in two-tower models is ensuring that both towers learn independently during training, as relevance can interfere with the learning of position bias.</li> <li>Techniques such as Dropout have been employed to reduce over-reliance on certain features, such as position, and to enhance generalization.-</li> </ul> </li> <li>Overall, the two-tower model is recognized as an effective approach for building unbiased ranking models in recommender systems. It remains a promising area of research, with significant potential for further development.</li> </ul> <h3 id="split-network">Split Network</h3> <ul> <li>A split network is a generalized version of a two tower network. The same optimization of embedding lookup holds here as well. Instead of a dot product, a simple neural network could be used to produce output.</li> <li>The image below <a href="https://medium.com/better-ml/recsys-model-serving-model-architectures-serving-1b5f038848bd">(source)</a> showcases this.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://aman.ai/recsys/assets/architectures/3.webp" alt=""/></p> <ul> <li>In a split network architecture, different components of the recommendation model are split and processed separately. For example, the user and item features may be processed independently and combined in a later stage. This allows for parallel processing and efficient handling of large-scale recommender systems. <ul> <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Enables parallel processing, efficient handling of large-scale systems, and flexibility in designing and optimizing different components separately.</li> <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires additional coordination and synchronization between the split components, potentially increasing complexity.</li> <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Scalability, flexibility, and improved performance in handling large-scale recommender systems.</li> <li><strong>Example Use Case:</strong> Recommendation systems with a massive number of users and items, where parallel processing is crucial for efficient computation.</li> <li><strong>Phase:</strong> Candidate Generation, Ranking, Final Ranking.</li> <li><strong>Recommendation Workflow:</strong> The split network architecture can be utilized in various phases. During the candidate generation phase, the split network can be used to process user and item features independently, allowing efficient retrieval of potential candidate items. In the ranking phase, the split network can be employed to learn representations and capture interactions between the user and candidate items. Finally, in the final ranking phase, the split network can contribute to the overall ranking of the candidate items based on learned representations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="summary-9">Summary</h2> <ul> <li>Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) represents a pioneering approach in recommender systems. It was one of the initial studies to replace the then-standard linear matrix factorization algorithms with neural networks, thus facilitating the integration of deep learning into recommender systems.</li> <li>The Wide &amp; Deep model underscored the significance of cross features—specifically, second-order features formed by intersecting two original features. This model effectively combines a broad, shallow module for handling cross features with a deep module, paralleling the approach of NCF.</li> <li>Deep and Cross Neural Network (DCN) was among the first to transition from manually engineered cross features to an algorithmic method capable of autonomously generating all potential feature crosses to any desired order.</li> <li>Deep Factorization Machine (DeepFM) shares conceptual similarities with DCN. However, it distinctively substitutes the cross layers in DCN with factorization machines, or more specifically, dot products.</li> <li>Automatic Interactions (AutoInt) brought multi-head self-attention mechanisms, previously known in Large Language Models (LLMs), into the domain of feature interaction. This technique moves away from brute-force generation of all possible feature interactions, which can lead to model overfitting on noisy feature crosses. Instead, it employs attention mechanisms to enable the model to selectively focus on the most relevant feature interactions.</li> <li>Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) marked a departure from previous models by discarding the deep module. It relies solely on an interaction layer that computes dot products, akin to the factorization machine component in DeepFM, followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This model emphasizes the sufficiency of interaction layers alone.</li> <li>Deep Hierarchical Embedding Network (DHEN) builds upon the DLRM framework by replacing the conventional dot product with a sophisticated hierarchy of feature interactions, including dot product, convolution, self-attention akin to AutoInt, and crossing features similar to those in DCN.</li> <li>Gated Deep Cross Network (GDCN) enhances Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction in recommender systems by improving interpretability, efficiency, and handling of high-order feature interactions.</li> <li>The Two Tower model in recommender systems, known for its separate user and candidate towers, optimizes personalized recommendations and addresses biases like position bias, representing an evolving and powerful approach in building unbiased ranking models.</li> </ul> <h2 id="comparative-analysis">Comparative Analysis</h2> <ul> <li>This table offers a detailed comparative analysis table summarizing the key characteristics of various recommender system architectures in terms of features, advantages, limitations, use cases, and applicable phases in recommendation workflows.</li> </ul> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Technique</strong></th> <th><strong>Key Features</strong></th> <th><strong>Advantages</strong></th> <th><strong>Limitations</strong></th> <th><strong>Example Use Cases</strong></th> <th><strong>Phase</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Wide and Deep (2016)</td> <td>Combines a wide linear model for memorization with a deep neural network for generalization.

id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948">DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero</a> represent a landmark in reasoning-capable Large Language Models (LLMs). <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">Released</a> under an MIT license, this model rivals closed-source giants like OpenAI’s o1 and o3 series while pioneering a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for reasoning tasks.</li> <li>Both models leverage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300">DeepSeekMath</a>, which replaces traditional methods like PPO, making training both efficient and scalable. They also utilize Multihead Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04434">DeepSeek-V2</a>, which reduces computational and memory inefficiencies particularly for long-context processing by projecting Key-Query-Value (KQV) matrices into a lower-dimensional latent space.</li> <li>DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates how reasoning capabilities emerge naturally purely through RL without any Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). By relying solely on self-evolution through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally developed powerful reasoning behaviors but also exhibited challenges such as poor readability and language mixing. DeepSeek-R1 built upon this foundation and addressed the aforementioned issues by incorporating multi-stage training and a small amount of cold-start data to improve reasoning performance and usability.</li> <li>Through innovations like GRPO, FP8 quantization, and emergent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, both models rival closed-source models while fostering transparency and accessibility. As the research community builds upon these innovations, DeepSeek-R1 signals a shift towards efficient, reasoning-driven AI accessible to all.</li> <li>This primer explores its architecture, multi-stage training pipeline, GRPO mechanics, and emergent reasoning behaviors, alongside how distillation propagates reasoning capabilities to smaller models.</li> </ul> <h2 id="architectural-foundations">Architectural Foundations</h2> <ul> <li>DeepSeek-R1 builds upon the foundational advancements introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434">DeepSeek-V2</a> — specifically, Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Multihead Latent Attention (MLA) — and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437">DeepSeek-V3</a> — specifically, Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) — integrating cutting-edge architectural innovations that optimize both training efficiency and inference performance.</li> <li>This section provides a detailed breakdown of the architectural components that evolved from DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-V3 to DeepSeek-R1, highlighting improvements that make DeepSeek-R1 a leading open-source model, capable of rivaling proprietary alternatives in reasoning efficiency and performance.</li> </ul> <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3> <ul> <li> <p>DeepSeek-R1 incorporates several advanced techniques to achieve remarkable efficiency improvements:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture</strong>: DeepSeek-R1 utilizes a Mixture of Experts model, which decomposes a large model into smaller, specialized sub-models. This architecture allows for the activation of only relevant sub-models during specific tasks, enabling the system to operate efficiently on consumer-grade GPUs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Key-Value Memory Compression via Multihead Latent Attention (MLA)</strong>: By implementing sophisticated compression algorithms, DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 93% reduction in the storage requirements for key-value indices, which are known to consume considerable amounts of VRAM.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multi-Token Prediction</strong>: DeepSeek-R1 is designed to predict multiple tokens simultaneously rather than one at a time. This strategy effectively doubles the inference speed, enhancing overall performance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Low-Precision Computation</strong>: DeepSeek-R1 employs mixed-precision arithmetic, performing a significant portion of computations using 8-bit floating-point numbers instead of the standard 32-bit. This approach substantially reduces memory consumption and accelerates processing speeds.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Collectively, these innovations contribute to DeepSeek-R1’s significant advancements in training efficiency, reportedly achieving a 45-fold improvement over previous models.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="mixture-of-experts-moe">Mixture of Experts (MoE)</h3> <h4 id="overview-1">Overview</h4> <ul> <li>The MoE mechanism selectively activates a subset of the total model parameters at each inference step, achieving computational savings while maintaining model quality. This approach enables scaling up model parameters without a proportional increase in computational cost.</li> <li>DeepSeek-R1 refines DeepSeek-V2’s MoE framework, introducing dynamic expert routing, reinforcement learning-based load balancing, and enhanced sparsity constraints. These innovations make DeepSeek-R1 one of the most efficient and scalable open-source MoE models available.</li> </ul> <h4 id="key-features">Key Features</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning-Based Expert Routing</strong>: DeepSeek-R1 replaces static gating functions with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to dynamically assign tokens to experts. The RL-based router optimizes expert selection by maximizing load balancing while minimizing routing entropy, leading to more efficient token-expert mapping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hierarchical Entropy-Gated MoE (HE-MoE)</strong>: The expert selection process is refined with a multi-level gating mechanism. Tokens first pass through a global selection phase, followed by cluster-level pruning, and finally, an entropy-aware adjustment ensures balanced expert activation. This approach prevents expert over-specialization and improves generalization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Device-Constrained Expert Allocation (DCEA)</strong>: Experts are assigned based on available compute resources, reducing cross-device communication overhead. The model selects experts within a constrained pool of devices, lowering synchronization costs and increasing training efficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Load-Balanced Expert Utilization with RL-Based Adjustments</strong>: Instead of relying on auxiliary loss functions to balance load, DeepSeek-R1 dynamically adjusts expert activation probabilities using RL-based bias terms. This ensures consistent workload distribution without additional loss penalties, improving stability and convergence.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Full Token Retention (No Token Dropping)</strong>: Unlike earlier iterations that dropped low-affinity tokens to balance computational load, DeepSeek-R1 retains all tokens during both training and inference. This ensures that no information is lost, leading to improved model coherence and generalization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cross-Device Communication Optimization</strong>: With DCEA and hierarchical expert gating, DeepSeek-R1 significantly reduces inter-device communication, leading to up to a 35% decrease in latency. This optimization enhances efficiency without sacrificing model performance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dynamic Expert Activation</strong>: The model adapts expert selection dynamically using learned routing strategies, ensuring efficient allocation of computational resources. This allows DeepSeek-R1 to scale effectively without a linear increase in computational cost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adaptive Expert Specialization</strong>: By incorporating entropy-based constraints, DeepSeek-R1 ensures that experts remain specialized but not overly rigid. This dynamic specialization enhances both accuracy and efficiency while maintaining flexibility in expert activation.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="evolution-from-deepseek-v2-to-deepseek-r1">Evolution from DeepSeek-V2 to DeepSeek-R1</h4> <h5 id="moe-in-deepseek-v2">MoE in DeepSeek-V2</h5> <ul> <li>DeepSeek-V2 introduces a specialized MoE architecture called DeepSeekMoE, which optimizes model training efficiency and inference throughput while maintaining strong performance. This architecture refines expert selection, routing, and load balancing strategies to reduce computational overhead. Below, we detail the MoE-specific mechanisms in DeepSeek-V2, breaking them down into their individual components.</li> </ul> <h6 id="basic-architecture-of-deepseekmoe">Basic Architecture of DeepSeekMoE</h6> <ul> <li>DeepSeekMoE is designed with fine-grained expert segmentation and shared expert isolation, which increase specialization while reducing redundancy. The MoE architecture in DeepSeek-V2 consists of: <ul> <li>Ns shared experts, which process all tokens.</li> <li>Nr routed experts, which are selectively activated for tokens based on a gating function.</li> <li>Each token is processed by a fixed number Kr of routed experts.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The output of the MoE layer is computed as:</p> <p>ht′=ut+∑i=1NsFFNi(s)(ut)+∑i=1Nrgi,tFFNi(r)(ut)</p> <ul> <li>where: <ul> <li>FFNi(s) represents a shared expert.</li> <li>FFNi(r) represents a routed expert.</li> <li>gi,t is the gating function, determining expert selection for token t.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The gating function follows:</p> <p>gi,t={si,t,si,t∈Top-Kr({sj,t∣1≤j≤Nr})0,otherwise</p> <ul> <li>where si,t is the softmax-weighted token-expert affinity:</li> </ul> <p>si,t=Softmaxi(utTei)</p> <ul> <li>where ei is the centroid of expert i.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h6 id="device-limited-routing">Device-Limited Routing</h6> <ul> <li>One of the major computational bottlenecks in MoE models is the communication overhead introduced by expert parallelism. To address this, DeepSeekMoE implements device-limited routing, restricting the number of devices a token’s experts can be distributed across.</li> <li><strong>Key implementation details:</strong> <ul> <li>Each token first selects M devices with the highest affinity scores.</li> <li>The final Kr experts are chosen only from these selected devices.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In practice, setting M≥3 ensures performance close to unrestricted routing while significantly reducing inter-device communication.</li> </ul> <h5 id="auxiliary-loss-for-load-balancing">Auxiliary Loss for Load Balancing</h5> <ul> <li> <p>DeepSeek-V2 employs multiple auxiliary losses to ensure balanced expert utilization, avoiding situations where certain experts become overloaded while others remain underutilized. Specifics below:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Expert-Level Balance Loss</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>To prevent routing collapse, where only a subset of experts get trained, DeepSeek-V2 minimizes:</li> </ul> <p>LExpBal=α1∑i=1NrfiPi</p> <ul> <li>where: <ul> <li>fi is the fraction of tokens routed to expert i,</li> <li>Pi is the average probability of selecting expert i,</li> <li>α1 is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the loss.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Device-Level Balance Loss</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>To distribute computation evenly across devices, DeepSeekMoE assigns experts to D device groups, where each group runs on a separate device.

Traditionally, AI models trained for complex reasoning tasks leverage large datasets composed of human-annotated examples. However, such datasets often lack comprehensive coverage and may not contain optimal solutions. RL circumvents this limitation by allowing AI models to explore solutions autonomously, refining their strategies based on reward-driven feedback mechanisms.</li> <li>Consider an AI model trained to play chess. Instead of learning from a fixed dataset of historical games, the AI is programmed with only the fundamental rules of chess. It then engages in self-play, continuously experimenting with various moves. Initially, the model executes suboptimal actions, leading to losses. However, through iterative play, it identifies effective strategies and reinforces moves that contribute to victories while discarding ineffective ones. This trial-and-error process, governed by RL principles, enables the AI to develop strategies surpassing human intuition.</li> <li>DeepSeek applies this RL-based approach to reasoning-intensive domains, such as mathematical problem-solving. Rather than training on explicit mathematical derivations, the AI is provided with fundamental mathematical rules and tasked with solving problems autonomously. The model systematically explores various solution paths, reinforcing those that yield correct answers while discarding ineffective methodologies. Over time, this process enhances the AI’s mathematical reasoning abilities beyond traditional supervised learning approaches.

Instead of learning a value function, GRPO derives relative rewards from multiple sampled responses. This enables efficient and stable policy updates while reducing computational overhead.</li> </ul> <h6 id="grpo-intuition">GRPO Intuition</h6> <ul> <li> <p>To understand GRPO, it is useful to analyze its mathematical formulation from a reverse-engineering perspective. The complexity of the equations can be misleading; in reality, GRPO consists of three main components:</p> <p>JGRPO=min([Block 1],[Block 2])−[Block 3]</p> <ul> <li>where: <ul> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Block 1 corresponds to the first term inside the summation of the GRPO objective function: ρiAi=πθ(oi</td> <td>q)πθold(oi</td> <td>q)Ai. This represents the primary objective of policy optimization: ensuring the updated policy πθ improves upon the previous policy πθold. The core principle is straightforward: the new policy should outperform the old one in expectation.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li>Block 2 corresponds to the clipped version of ρiAi, i.e., clip(ρi,1−ϵ,1+ϵ)Ai. This originates from PPO and serves as a safeguard to prevent excessive updates. By taking the minimum between Block 1 and this clipped value, GRPO ensures training stability and prevents over-exaggerated policy updates.</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Block 3 corresponds to the KL-divergence regularization term in the GRPO equation: βDKL(πθ</td> <td> </td> <td>πref). This term enforces similarity between the new policy and a reference policy, preventing the optimization process from deviating too far from the original distribution and ensuring controlled updates.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>One of the most notable aspects of GRPO’s success is its redesigned approach to advantage computation. Traditional PPO computes advantages using a learned value network combined with temporal difference learning, requiring additional memory and computation to maintain a separate critic model. In contrast, GRPO fundamentally simplifies this by directly comparing sampled actions within a group and leveraging statistical normalization to compute advantages. This group-based methodology eliminates the need for a value network, significantly reducing memory overhead—by approximately half—while simultaneously aligning with the core principle of evaluating mathematical solutions relative to other approaches to the same problem.</li> <li>This design choice has proven especially effective for mathematical reasoning tasks. By using a direct group-based comparison, GRPO enhances the model’s ability to develop structured reasoning strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that this method not only improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks but also maintains training stability and computational efficiency. The elimination of the critic network removes potential biases from learned value functions, making GRPO particularly well-suited for domains requiring objective evaluation of multiple solution paths.</li> <li>Additionally, the “Group” aspect in GRPO refers to computing the expectation over a set of sampled outputs, which are then averaged to stabilize training. The presence of normalization within A (mean and standard deviation) may initially appear complex, but it simply follows conventional normalization techniques used in machine learning.</li> <li>Thus, when stripped of indices, subscripts, and hyperparameters, GRPO reduces to a simple balance between policy improvement and control mechanisms, reinforcing why it is regarded as an efficient and

This is my personal notebook.</p> <p>The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT. We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via <a href="https://github.com/opendilab/awesome-RLHF">RLHF</a>). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.</p> <p>A large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.</p> <p>There is also a branch of work on attacking LLMs to extract pre-training data, private knowledge (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805">Carlini et al, 2020</a>) or attacking model training process via data poisoning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10149">Carlini et al. 2023</a>). We would not cover those topics in this post.</p> <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2> <h3 id="threat-model">Threat Model</h3> <p>Adversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired. Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/threats-overview.png" alt="overview"/></p> <p>Fig. 1. An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173">Greshake et al. 2023</a>)</p> <h3 id="classification">Classification</h3> <p>Adversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $x$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $x_{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $x$, such that $f(x) \neq f(x_{adv})$.</p> <h3 id="text-generation">Text Generation</h3> <p>Given an input $x$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $y ~ p(.|x)$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(x)$ that $y$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $y$ is unsafe or human review.</p> <h3 id="white-box-vs-black-box">White-box vs Black-box</h3> <p>White-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models. Black-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $x$ and get back sample $y$, without knowing further information about the model.</p> <h3 id="types-of-adversarial-attacks">Types of Adversarial Attacks</h3> <p>There are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Attack</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Token manipulation</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Alter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gradient based attack</td> <td>White-box</td> <td>Rely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jailbreak prompting</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Often heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Human red-teaming</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Human attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Model red-teaming</td> <td>Black-box</td> <td>Model attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="token-manipulation">Token Manipulation</h3> <p>Given a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.</p> <p>Ribeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.</p> <p>In comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei &amp; Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion.

BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.</p> <h2 id="gradient-based-attacks">Gradient based Attacks</h2> <p>In the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.</p> <p><strong>GBDA</strong> (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13733">Guo et al. 2021</a>) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to <em>make adversarial loss optimization differentiable</em>, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens where one token can be sampled from a categorical distribution , where and is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that is usually around and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:</p> <p>where is a vector of token probabilities for the -th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label for a classifier : . However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144">Jang et al. 2016</a>) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution by :</p> <p>where ; the temperature controls the smoothness of the distribution.</p> <p>Gumbel distribution is used to model the <em>extreme</em> value, maximum or minimum, of a number of samples, irrespective of the sample distribution. The additional Gumbel noise brings in the stochastic decisioning that mimic the sampling process from the categorical distribution.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/gumbel.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 2. The probability density plot of .

The “sampling” portion only depends on the value of , which is mostly centered around 0.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/gumbel-softmax.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 3. When the temperature is , it reflects the original categorical distribution. When , it becomes a uniform distribution. The expectations and samples from Gumbel softmax distribution matched well. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144">Jang et al. 2016</a>)</p> <p>Let be the embedding representation of token . We can approximate with , a weighted average of the embedding vector corresponding to the token probabilities: . Note that when is a one-hot vector corresponding to the token , we would have . Combining the embedding representation with the Gumbel-softmax approximation, we have a differentiable objective to minimize: .</p> <p>Meanwhile, it is also easy to apply differentiable soft constraints with white-box attacks. GBDA experimented with (1) a soft fluency constraint using NLL (negative log-likelihood) and (2) BERTScore (<em>“a similarity score for evaluating text generation that captures the semantic similarity between pairwise tokens in contextualized embeddings of a transformer model.”</em>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675">Zhang et al. 2019</a>) to measure similarity between two text inputs to ensure the perturbed version does not diverge from the original version too much. Combining all constraints, the final objective function is as follows, where are preset hyperparameters to control the strength of soft constraints:</p> <p>Gumbel-softmax tricks are hard to be extended to token deletion or addition and thus it is restricted to only token replacement operations, not deletion or addition.</p> <p><strong>HotFlip</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06751">Ebrahimi et al. 2018</a>) treats text operations as inputs in the vector space and measures the derivative of loss with regard to these vectors. Here let’s assume the input vector is a matrix of character-level one-hot encodings, and , where is the maximum number of words, is the maximum number of characters per word and is the alphabet size. Given the original input vector , we construct a new vector with the -th character of the -th word changing from , and thus we have but .</p> <p>The change in loss according to first-order Taylor expansion is:</p> <p>This objective is optimized to select the vector to minimize the adversarial loss using only one backward propagation.</p> <p>To apply multiple flips, we can run a beam search of steps of the beam width , taking forward steps. HotFlip can be extended to token deletion or addition by representing that with multiple flip operations in the form of position shifts.</p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125">Wallace et al. (2019)</a> proposed a gradient-guided search over tokens to find short sequences (E.g. 1 token for classification and 4 tokens for generation), named <strong>Universal Adversarial Triggers</strong> (<strong>UAT</strong>), to trigger a model to produce a specific prediction. UATs are input-agnostic, meaning that these trigger tokens can be concatenated as prefix (or suffix) to any input from a dataset to take effect. Given any text input sequence from a data distribution , attackers can optimize the triggering tokens leading to a target class (, different from the ground truth) :</p> <p>Then let’s apply <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/#hotflip">HotFlip</a> to search for the most effective token based on the change in loss approximated by first-order Taylor expansion. We would convert the triggering tokens into their one-hot embedding representations, each vector of dimension size , form and update the embedding of every trigger tokens to minimize the first-order Taylor expansion:</p> <p>where is the embedding matrix of all the tokens. is the average gradient of the task loss over a batch around the current embedding of the -th token in the adversarial triggering sequence . We can brute-force the optimal by a big dot product of size embedding of the entire vocabulary the embedding dimension . Matrix multiplication of this size is cheap and can be run in parallel.</p> <p><strong>AutoPrompt</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15980">Shin et al., 2020</a>) utilizes the same gradient-based search strategy to find the most effective prompt template for a diverse set of tasks.</p> <p>The above token search method can be augmented with beam search. When looking for the optimal token embedding , we can pick top- candidates instead of a single one, searching from left to right and score each beam by on the current data batch.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UAT.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 4. Illustration of how Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) works. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125">Wallace et al. 2019</a>)</p> <p>The design of the loss for UAT is task-specific. Classification or reading comprehension relies on cross entropy. In their experiment, conditional text generation is configured to maximize the likelihood of a language model generating similar content to a set of bad outputs given any user input:</p> <p>It is impossible to exhaust the entire space of in practice, but the paper got decent results by representing each set with a small number of examples. For example, their experiments used only 30 manually written racist and non-racist tweets as approximations for respectively. They later found that a small number of examples for and ignoring (i.e. no in the formula above) give good enough results.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UAT-examples.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 5. Samples of Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) on different types of language tasks. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125">Wallace et al. 2019</a>)</p> <p>Why UATs work is an interesting question. Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.</p> <p>One drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02392">Mehrabi et al. (2022)</a> studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations. The goal is to create attack messages that can effectively trigger toxic responses from a model given a conversation, while the attack is fluent, coherent and relevant to this conversation.</p> <p>They explored two variations of UAT:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Variation #1: <strong>UAT-LM</strong> (Universal Adversarial Trigger with Language Model Loss) adds a constraint on language model logprob on the trigger tokens, , to encourage the model to learn sensical token combination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Variation #2: <strong>UTSC</strong> (Unigram Trigger with Selection Criteria) follows a few steps to generate attack messages by (1) first generating a set of <em>unigram</em> UAT tokens, (2) and then passing these unigram triggers and conversation history to the language model to generate different attack utterances. Generated attacks are filtered according to toxicity scores of different toxicity classifiers. UTSC-1, UTSC-2 and UTSC-3 adopt three filter criteria, by maximum toxicity score, maximum toxicity score when above a threshold, and minimum score, respectively.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UTSC.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 6.

(Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02392">Mehrabi et al. 2022</a>)</p> <p>UAT-LM and UTSC-1 are performing comparable to UAT baseline, but perplexity of UAT attack phrases are absurdly high (~ 10**7; according to GPT-2), much higher than UAT-LM (~10**4) and UTSC-1 (~160). High perplexity makes an attack more vulnerable to be detected and mitigated. UTSC-1 attacks are shown to be more coherent, fluent and relevant than others, according to human evaluation.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/UAT-variation.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 7. Attack success rate measured by different toxicity classifiers on the defender model’s response to generated attacks. The “Safety classifier” is from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07079">Xu et al. 2020</a>.

(2023)</a> also studied universal adversarial triggering tokens as suffixes in concatenation to the input request. They specifically looked into malicious requests for LLMs for which the model should refuse to answer. In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774">OpenAI 2023</a>). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output <strong>affirmative</strong> responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Sure, here is how to ..."</code>. The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"sure"</code> response. The loss function is simply the NLL of outputting target response.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/zou.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 8.

They adopted <strong>greedy coordinate gradient (GCG)</strong> based search to greedily find one candidate that can reduce the loss the most among all possible single-token substitutions. It is not feasible to literally evaluate all token substitutions, so they run gradient based token search strategy similar to <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/#UAT">UAT and AutoPrompt</a> to find top candidates per token, each associated with the largest negative gradient of the loss.</p> <p>Given a set of expected input-output pairs (E.g. the input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Give instructions for building a pipe bomb"</code>, will be associated with an output <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Sure, here’s instructions for building a pipe bomb:"</code>) and an adversarial suffix of length :</p> <ol> <li>Per token in the adversarial suffix , we find the top values with largest negative gradient of NLL loss, , of the language model .

They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/tasks/bot_adversarial_dialogue">BAD dataset</a> (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/bot_adversarial_dialogue">Tensorflow dataset</a>), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/hh-rlhf/tree/master/red-team-attempts">red-teaming dataset</a> from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07858">Ganguli, et al. 2022</a>).

Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model to play adversarially against a target LLM to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.</p> <p>Assuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286">Perez et al. 2022</a>). Let be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output is harmful given a test input . Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:</p> <ol> <li>Sample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM .</li> <li>Use the target LLM to generate an output for each test case .</li> <li>Identify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier .</li> </ol> <p>They experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,</p> <ul> <li><em>Zero-shot generation</em>: This is to find a number of prompts that can trigger harmful output conditioned on a preset prompt.</li> <li><em>Stochastic few-shot generation</em>: The red team prompts found from the above step are then used as few-shot examples to generate more similar cases. Each zero-shot test case might be selected in few-shot examples with a probability</li> <li><em>Supervised learning</em>: The red team model can be fine-tuned on failing, zero-shot test cases. The training only runs lightly for one epoch to avoid overfitting and preserve sample diversity.</li> <li><em>Reinforcement learning</em>: Because the sampling steps are non-differentiable, a standard RL fine-tuning is needed to maximize the reward , with a KL divergence term between current and the initial model behavior, where is a sample from the target model, . The paper warm-started the model from the supervised fine-tuned version and applied <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-04-08-policy-gradient/#a2c">A2C</a> RL algorithm.</li> </ul> <p>The experiment used the <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/tasks/bot_adversarial_dialogue">BAD (Bot Adversarial Dialogue) dataset</a> and generated red team test cases using a simple prompt:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;span&gt;List of questions to ask someone:&lt;/span&gt;

The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.</p> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/anthropic-redteam.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 14.

It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.</p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09442">Casper et al. (2023)</a> set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286">Perez et al. (2022)</a> is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier. There are three steps:</p> <ol> <li><em>Explore</em>: Sample from the model and examine the outputs. Embedding based clustering is applied to downsample with enough diversity.</li> <li><em>Establish</em>: Humans judge the model outputs as good vs bad. Then a harmfulness classifier is trained with human labels. <ul> <li>On the dishonesty experiment, the paper compared human labels with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GPT-3.5-turbo</code> labels. Although they disagreed on almost half of examples, classifiers trained with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GPT-3.5-turbo</code> or human labels achieved comparable accuracy.

The reward combines the harmfulness classifier score with a diversity constraint measured as intra-batch cosine distance of the target LM’s embeddings. The diversity term is to avoid mode collapse and removing this term in the RL loss leads to complete failure, generating nonsensical prompts.</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/explore-establish-exploit.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Fig. 15.

It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00614v2">Jain et al. 2023</a>, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"I'm sorry.
